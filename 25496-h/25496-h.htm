<h2><i>THE ROAD TO ROME; OR, THE<br />
SILLY STOWAWAY</i></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">We</span> Bastables have only two uncles, and
neither of them, are our own natural-born
relatives. One is a great-uncle, and the other
is the uncle from his birth of Albert, who used
to live next door to us in the Lewisham Road.
When we first got to know him (it was over
some baked potatoes, and is quite another
story) we called him Albert-next-door's-Uncle,
and then Albert's uncle for short. But
Albert's uncle and my father joined in taking
a jolly house in the country, called the Moat
House, and we stayed there for our summer
holidays; and it was there, through an accident
to a pilgrim with peas in his shoes&mdash;that's
another story too&mdash;that we found
Albert's uncle's long-lost love; and as she
was very old indeed&mdash;twenty-six next birthday&mdash;and
he was ever so much older in the
vale of years, he had to get married almost
directly, and it was fixed for about Christmas-time.
And when our holidays came the
whole six of us went down to the Moat
House with Father and Albert's uncle. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
never had a Christmas in the country before.
It was simply ripping. And the long-lost love&mdash;her
name was Miss Ashleigh, but we were
allowed to call her Aunt Margaret even before
the wedding made it really legal for us to do
so&mdash;she and her jolly clergyman brother used
to come over, and sometimes we went to the
Cedars, where they live, and we had games
and charades, and hide-and-seek, and Devil
in the Dark, which is a game girls pretend
to like, and very few do really, and crackers
and a Christmas-tree for the village children,
and everything you can jolly well think of.</div>

<p>And all the time, whenever we went to the
Cedars, there was all sorts of silly fuss going
on about the beastly wedding; boxes coming
from London with hats and jackets in, and
wedding presents&mdash;all glassy and silvery, or
else brooches and chains&mdash;and clothes sent
down from London to choose from. I can't
think how a lady can want so many petticoats
and boots and things just because she's
going to be married. No man would think
of getting twenty-four shirts and twenty-four
waistcoats, and so on, just to be married
in.</p>

<p>"It's because they're going to Rome, I
think," Alice said, when we talked it over
before the fire in the kitchen the day Mrs.
Pettigrew went to see her aunt, and we were
allowed to make toffee. "You see, in Rome
you can only buy Roman clothes, and I think
they're all stupid bright colours&mdash;at least I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
know the sashes are. You stir now, Oswald.
My face is all burnt black."</p>

<p>Oswald took the spoon, though it was really
not his turn by three; but he is one whose
nature is so that he cannot make a fuss about
little things&mdash;and he knows he can make
toffee.</p>

<p>"Lucky hounds," H.O. said, "to be going to
Rome. I wish I was."</p>

<p>"Hounds isn't polite, H.O., dear," Dora said;
and H.O. said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, lucky bargees, then."</p>

<p>"It's the dream of my life to go to Rome,"
No&euml;l said. No&euml;l is our poet brother. "Just
think of what the man says in the 'Roman
Road.' I wish they'd take me."</p>

<p>"They won't," Dicky said. "It costs a
most awful lot. I heard Father saying so
only yesterday."</p>

<p>"It would only be the fare," No&euml;l answered;
"and I'd go third, or even in a cattle-truck, or
a luggage van. And when I got there I could
easily earn my own living. I'd make ballads
and sing them in the streets. The Italians
would give me lyres&mdash;that's the Italian kind
of shilling, they spell it with an <i>i</i>. It shows
how poetical they are out there, their calling
it that."</p>

<p>"But you couldn't make Italian poetry,"
H.O. said, staring at No&euml;l with his mouth open.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know so much about that,"
No&euml;l said. "I could jolly soon learn anyway,
and just to begin with I'd do it in English.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
There are sure to be some people who would
understand. And if they didn't, don't you
think their warm Southern hearts would be
touched to see a pale, slender, foreign figure
singing plaintive ballads in an unknown
tongue? I do. Oh! they'd chuck along the
lyres fast enough&mdash;they're not hard and cold
like North people. Why, every one here is a
brewer, or a baker, or a banker, or a butcher,
or something dull. Over there they're all
bandits, or vineyardiners, or play the guitar,
or something, and they crush the red grapes
and dance and laugh in the sun&mdash;you know
jolly well they do."</p>

<p>"This toffee's about done," said Oswald suddenly.
"H.O., shut your silly mouth and get
a cupful of cold water." And then, what
with dropping a little of the toffee into the
water to see if it was ready, and pouring some
on a plate that wasn't buttered and not being
able to get it off again when it was cold without
breaking the plate, and the warm row
there was about its being one of the best
dinner-service ones, the wild romances of
No&euml;l's poetical intellect went out of our
heads altogether; and it was not till later,
and when deep in the waters of affliction,
that they were brought back to us.</p>

<p>Next day H.O. said to Dora, "I want to
speak to you all by yourself and me." So they
went into the secret staircase that creaks and
hasn't been secret now for countless years;
and after that Dora did some white sewing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
she wouldn't let us look at, and H.O. helped
her.</p>

<span class="caption">DORA DID SOME WHITE SEWING.</span>
</div>

<p>"It's another wedding present, you may
depend," Dicky said&mdash;"a beastly surprise, I
shouldn't wonder." And no more was said.
The rest of us were busy skating on the moat,
for it was now freezing hard. Dora never did
care for skating; she says it hurts her feet.</p>

<p>And now Christmas and Boxing Day passed
like a radiating dream, and it was the wedding-day.
We all had to go to the bride's mother's
house before the wedding, so as to go to
church with the wedding party. The girls
had always wanted to be somebody's bridesmaids,
and now they were&mdash;in white cloth
coats like coachmen, with lots of little capes,
and white beaver bonnets. They didn't look
so bad, though rather as if they were in a
Christmas card; and their dresses were white
silk like pocket-handkerchiefs under the long
coats. And their shoes had real silver buckles
our great Indian uncle gave them. H.O.
went back just as the waggonette was starting,
and came out with a big brown-paper
parcel. We thought it was the secret surprise
present Dora had been making, and, indeed,
when I asked her she nodded. We little
recked what it really was, or how our young
brother was going to shove himself forward
once again. He <i>will</i> do it. Nothing you say
is of any lasting use.</p>

<p>There were a great many people at the
wedding&mdash;quite crowds. There was lots to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
eat and drink, and though it was all cold, it
did not matter, because there were blazing
fires in every fireplace in the house, and the
place all decorated with holly and mistletoe
and things. Every one seemed to enjoy
themselves very much, except Albert's uncle
and his blushing bride; and they looked
desperate. Every one said how sweet she
looked, but Oswald thought she looked as if
she didn't like being married as much as she
expected. She was not at all a blushing bride
really; only the tip of her nose got pink,
because it was rather cold in the church.
But she is very jolly.</p>

<p>Her reverend but nice brother read the
marriage service. He reads better than any
one I know, but he is not a bit of a prig
really, when you come to know him.</p>

<p>When the rash act was done Albert's uncle
and his bride went home in a carriage all by
themselves, and then we had the lunch and
drank the health of the bride in real
champagne, though Father said we kids must
only have just a taste. I'm sure Oswald, for
one, did not want any more; one taste was
quite enough. Champagne is like soda-water
with medicine in it. The sherry we put sugar
in once was much more decent.</p>

<p>Then Miss Ashleigh&mdash;I mean Mrs. Albert's
uncle&mdash;went away and took off her white
dress and came back looking much warmer.
Dora heard the housemaid say afterwards
that the cook had stopped the bride on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
stairs with "a basin of hot soup, that would
take no denial, because the bride, poor dear
young thing, not a bite or sup had passed her
lips that day." We understood then why she
had looked so unhappy. But Albert's uncle
had had a jolly good breakfast&mdash;fish and eggs
and bacon and three goes of marmalade. So
it was not hunger made him sad. Perhaps he
was thinking what a lot of money it cost to
be married and go to Rome.</p>

<p>A little before the bride went to change,
H.O. got up and reached his brown-paper
parcel from under the sideboard and sneaked
out. We thought he might have let us see it
given, whatever it was. And Dora said she had
understood he meant to; but it was his secret.</p>

<p>The bride went away looking quite comfy
in a furry cloak, and Albert's uncle cheered
up at the last and threw off the burden of his
cares and made a joke. I forget what it was;
it wasn't a very good one, but it showed he
was trying to make the best of things.</p>

<p>Then the Bridal Sufferers drove away, with
the luggage on a cart&mdash;heaps and heaps of it,
and we all cheered and threw rice and
slippers. Mrs. Ashleigh and some other old
ladies cried.</p>

<p>And then every one said, "What a pretty
wedding!" and began to go. And when our
waggonette came round we all began to get
in. And suddenly Father said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where's H.O.?" And we looked round.
He was in absence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fetch him along sharp&mdash;some of you,"
Father said; "I don't want to keep the horses
standing here in the cold all day."</p>

<p>So Oswald and Dicky went to fetch him
along. We thought he might have wandered
back to what was left of the lunch&mdash;for he is
young and he does not always know better.
But he was not there, and Oswald did not
even take a crystallised fruit in passing. He
might easily have done this, and no one would
have minded, so it would not have been
wrong. But it would have been ungentlemanly.
Dicky did not either. H.O. was not
there.</p>

<p>We went into the other rooms, even the
one the old ladies were crying in, but of
course we begged their pardons. And at
last into the kitchen, where the servants
were smart with white bows and just sitting
down to their dinner, and Dicky said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, cookie love, have you seen H.O.?"</p>

<p>"Don't come here with your imperence!"
the cook said, but she was pleased with
Dicky's unmeaning compliment all the same.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> see him," said the housemaid. "He
was colloguing with the butcher in the yard
a bit since. He'd got a brown-paper parcel.
Perhaps he got a lift home."</p>

<p>So we went and told Father, and about the
white present in the parcel.</p>

<p>"I expect he was ashamed to give it after
all," Oswald said, "so he hooked off home
with it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>And we got into the wagonette.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a present, though," Dora said;
"it was a different kind of surprise&mdash;but it
really is a secret."</p>

<p>Our good Father did not command her to
betray her young brother.</p>

<p>But when we got home H.O. wasn't there.
Mrs. Pettigrew hadn't seen him, and he was
nowhere about. Father biked back to the
Cedars to see if he'd turned up. No. Then
all the gentlemen turned out to look for him
through the length and breadth of the
land.</p>

<p>"He's too old to be stolen by gipsies," Alice
said.</p>

<p>"And too ugly," said Dicky.</p>

<p>"Oh <i>don't!</i>" said both the girls; "and now
when he's lost, too!"</p>

<p>We had looked for a long time before Mrs.
Pettigrew came in with a parcel she said the
butcher had left. It was not addressed, but
we knew it was H.O.'s, because of the label
on the paper from the shop where Father gets
his shirts. Father opened it at once.</p>

<p>Inside the parcel we found H.O.'s boots and
braces, his best hat and his chest-protector.
And Oswald felt as if we had found his
skeleton.</p>

<p>"Any row with any of you?" Father asked.
But there hadn't been any.</p>

<p>"Was he worried about anything? Done
anything wrong, and afraid to own up?"</p>

<p>We turned cold, for we knew what he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
meant. That parcel was so horribly like the
lady's hat and gloves that she takes off on the
seashore and leaves with a letter saying it has
come to this.</p>

<p>"<i>No</i>, <i>no</i>, <span class="smcap">no</span>, NO!" we all said. "He was
perfectly jolly all the morning."</p>

<p>Then suddenly Dicky leaned on the table
and one of H.O.'s boots toppled over, and
there was something white inside. It was a
letter. H.O. must have written it before we
left home. It said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Father and Every One</span>,&mdash;I am
going to be a Clown. When I am rich and
reveared I will come back rolling.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">"Your affectionate son,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Horace Octavius Bastable.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>"Rolling?" Father said.</p>

<p>"He means rolling in money," Alice said.
Oswald noticed that every one round the
table where H.O.'s boots were dignifiedly
respected as they lay, was a horrid pale
colour, like when the salt is thrown into
snapdragons.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" Dora cried, "that was it. He
asked me to make him a clown's dress and
keep it deeply secret. He said he wanted to
surprise Aunt Margaret and Albert's uncle.
And I didn't think it was wrong," said Dora,
screwing up her face; she then added, "Oh
dear, oh dear, oh, oh!" and with these concluding
remarks she began to howl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Father thumped her on the back in an
absent yet kind way.</p>

<p>"But where's he gone?" he said, not to
any one in particular. "I saw the butcher; he
said H.O. asked him to take a parcel home
and went back round the Cedars."</p>

<p>Here Dicky coughed and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I didn't think he meant anything, but the
day after No&euml;l was talking about singing
ballads in Rome, and getting poet's lyres
given him, H.O. did say if No&euml;l had been
really keen on the Roman lyres and things he
could easily have been a stowaway, and gone
unknown."</p>

<p>"A stowaway!" said my Father, sitting
down suddenly and hard.</p>

<p>"In Aunt Margaret's big dress basket&mdash;the
one she let him hide in when we had hide-and-seek
there. He talked a lot about it after
No&euml;l had said that about the lyres&mdash;and the
Italians being so poetical, you know. You
remember that day we had toffee."</p>

<p>My Father is prompt and decisive in action,
so is his eldest son.</p>

<p>"I'm off to the Cedars," he said.</p>

<p>"Do let me come, Father," said the decisive
son. "You may want to send a message."</p>

<p>So in a moment Father was on his bike and
Oswald on the step&mdash;a dangerous but delightful
spot&mdash;and off to the Cedars.</p>

<p>"Have your teas; and <i>don't</i> any more of
you get lost, and don't sit up if we're late,"
Father howled to them as we rushed away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
How glad then the thoughtful Oswald was
that he was the eldest. It was very cold in
the dusk on the bicycle, but Oswald did not
complain.</p>

<p>At the Cedars my father explained in a few
manly but well-chosen words, and the apartment
of the dear departed bride was searched.</p>

<p>"Because," said my father, "if H.O. really
was little ass enough to get into that basket,
he must have turned out something to make
room for himself."</p>

<p>Sure enough, when they came to look, there
was a great bundle rolled in a sheet under
the bed&mdash;all lace things and petticoats and
ribbons and dressing-gowns and ladies'
flummery.</p>

<p>"If you will put the things in something
else, I'll catch the express to Dover and take
it with me," Father said to Mrs. Ashleigh; and
while she packed the things he explained to
some of the crying old ladies who had been
unable to leave off, how sorry he was that a
son of his&mdash;but you know the sort of thing.</p>

<p>Oswald said: "Father, I wish you'd let me
come too. I won't be a bit of trouble."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was partly because my Father
didn't want to let me walk home in the dark,
and he didn't want to worry the Ashleighs
any more by asking them to send me home.
He said this was why, but I hope it was his
loving wish to have his prompt son, so like
himself in his decisiveness, with him.</p>

<p>We went.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>It was an anxious journey. We knew how
far from pleased the bride would be to find
no dressing-gowns and ribbons, but only H.O.
crying and cross and dirty, as likely as not,
when she opened the basket at the hotel at
Dover.</p>

<p>Father smoked to pass the time, but Oswald
had not so much as a peppermint or a bit of
Spanish liquorice to help him through the
journey. Yet he bore up.</p>

<p>When we got out at Dover there were Mr.
and Mrs. Albert's uncle on the platform.</p>

<p>"Hullo," said Albert's uncle. "What's up?
Nothing wrong at home, I hope."</p>

<p>"We've only lost H.O.," said my father.
"You don't happen to have him with you?"</p>

<p>"No; but you're joking," said the bride.
"We've lost a dress-basket."</p>

<p><i>Lost a dress-basket!</i> The words struck us
dumb, but my father recovered speech and
explained. The bride was very glad when we
said we had brought her ribbons and things,
but we stood in anxious gloom, for now H.O.
was indeed lost. The dress-basket might be
on its way to Liverpool, or rocking on the
Channel, and H.O. might never be found
again. Oswald did not say these things. It
is best to hold your jaw when you want to
see a thing out, and are liable to be sent to
bed at a strange hotel if any one happens to
remember you.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the station master came
with a telegram.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>It said: "A dress-basket without label at
Cannon Street detained for identification
suspicious sounds from inside detain
inquirers dynamite machine suspected."</p>

<p>He did not show us this till my Father had
told him about H.O., which it took some time
for him to believe, and then he did and
laughed, and said he would wire them to get
the dynamite machine to speak, and if so, to
take it out and keep it till its Father called for
it.</p>

<p>So back we went to London, with hearts a
little lighter, but not gay, for we were a very
long time from the last things we had had to
eat. And Oswald was almost sorry he had
not taken those crystallised fruits.</p>

<p>It was quite late when we got to Cannon
Street, and we went straight into the cloakroom,
and there was the man in charge, a
very jolly chap, sitting on a stool. And there
was H.O., the guilty stowaway, dressed in a
red-and-white clown's dress, very dusty, and
his face as dirty as I have ever seen it, sitting
on some one else's tin box, with his feet on
some body else's portmanteau, eating bread
and cheese, and drinking ale out of a can.</p>

<p>My Father claimed him at once, and Oswald
identified the basket. It was very large.
There was a tray on the top with hats in it,
and H.O. had this on top of him. We all
went to bed in Cannon Street Hotel. My
Father said nothing to H.O. that night.
When we were in bed I tried to get H.O. to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
tell me all about it, but he was too sleepy
and cross. It was the beer and the knocking
about in the basket, I suppose. Next day we
went back to the Moat House, where the raving
anxiousness of the others had been cooled
the night before by a telegram from Dover.</p>

<p>My Father said he would speak to H.O. in
the evening. It is very horrid not to be
spoken to at once and get it over. But H.O.
certainly deserved something.</p>

<p>It is hard to tell this tale, because so much
of it happened all at once but at different
places. But this is what H.O. said to us
about it. He said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't bother&mdash;let me alone."</p>

<p>But we were all kind and gentle, and at
last we got it out of him what had happened.
He doesn't tell a story right from the
beginning like Oswald and some of the
others do, but from his disjunctured words
the author has made the following narration.
This is called editing, I believe.</p>

<p>"It was all No&euml;l's fault," H.O. said; "what
did he want to go jawing about Rome for?&mdash;and
a clown's as good as a beastly poet, anyhow!
You remember that day we made toffee? Well, I
thought of it then."</p>

<p>"You didn't tell us."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. I half told Dicky. He never
said don't, or you'd better not, or gave me
any good advice or anything. It's his fault
as much as mine. Father ought to speak to
him to-night the same as me&mdash;and No&euml;l, too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>We bore with him just then because we
wanted to hear the story. And we made him
go on.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;so I thought if No&euml;l's a cowardy
custard I'm not&mdash;and I wasn't afraid of being
in the basket, though it was quite dark till
I cut the air-holes with my knife in the
railway van. I think I cut the string off the
label. It fell off afterwards, and I saw it
through the hole, but of course I couldn't say
anything. I thought they'd look after their
silly luggage better than that. It was all
their fault I was lost."</p>

<p>"Tell us how you did it, H.O. dear," Dora
said; "never mind about it being everybody
else's fault."</p>

<p>"It's yours as much as any one's, if you
come to that," H.O. said. "You made me
the clown dress when I asked you. You never
said a word about not. So there!"</p>

<p>"Oh, H.O., you <i>are</i> unkind!" Dora said.
"You know you said it was for a surprise for
the bridal pair."</p>

<p>"So it would have been, if they'd found me
at Rome, and I'd popped up like what I meant
to&mdash;like a jack-in-the-box&mdash;and said, 'Here we
are again!' in my clown's clothes, at them.
But it's all spoiled, and father's going to speak
to me this evening." H.O. sniffed every time
he stopped speaking. But we did not correct
him then. We wanted to hear about everything.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me straight out what
you were going to do?" Dicky asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because you'd jolly well have shut me up.
You always do if I want to do anything you
haven't thought of yourself."</p>

<p>"What did you take with you, H.O.?"
asked Alice in a hurry, for H.O. was now
sniffing far beyond a whisper.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd saved a lot of grub, only I forgot
it at the last. It's under the chest of drawers
in our room. And I had my knife&mdash;and I
changed into the clown's dress in the cupboard
at the Ashleighs&mdash;over my own things
because I thought it would be cold. And
then I emptied the rotten girl's clothes out
and hid them&mdash;and the top-hatted tray I just
put it on a chair near, and I got into the
basket, and I lifted the tray up over my head
and sat down and fitted it down over me&mdash;it's
got webbing bars, you know, across it. And
none of you would ever have thought of it,
let alone doing it."</p>

<p>"I should hope not," Dora said, but H.O.
went on unhearing.</p>

<p>"I began to think perhaps I wished I hadn't
directly they strapped up the basket. It was
beastly hot and stuffy&mdash;I had to cut an air-hole
in the cart, and I cut my thumb; it was
so bumpety. And they threw me about as if
I was coals&mdash;and wrong way up as often as
not. And the train was awful wobbly, and I
felt so sick, and if I'd had the grub I couldn't
have eaten it. I had a bottle of water. And
that was all right till I dropped the cork, and
I couldn't find it in the dark till the water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
got upset, and then I found the cork that
minute.</p>

<p>"And when they dumped the basket on to
the platform I was so glad to sit still a minute
without being jogged I nearly went to sleep.
And then I looked out, and the label was off,
and lying close by. And then some one gave
the basket a kick&mdash;big brute, I'd like to kick
him!&mdash;and said, 'What's this here?' And I
daresay I did squeak&mdash;like a rabbit-noise, you
know&mdash;and then some one said, 'Sounds like
live-stock, don't it? No label.' And he was
standing on the label all the time. I saw the
string sticking out under his nasty boot. And
then they trundled me off somewhere, on a
wheelbarrow it felt like, and dumped me down
again in a dark place&mdash;and I couldn't see
anything more."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said the thoughtful Oswald,
"what made them think you were a dynamite
machine?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that was awful!" H.O. said. "It was
my watch. I wound it up, just for something
to do. You know the row it makes since it
was broken, and I heard some one say, 'Shish!
what's that?' and then, 'Sounds like an infernal
machine'&mdash;don't go shoving me, Dora,
it was him said it, not me&mdash;and then, 'If I
was the inspector I'd dump it down in the
river, so I would. Any way, let's shift it.'
But the other said, 'Let well alone,' so I
wasn't dumped any more. And they fetched
another man, and there was a heap of jaw,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and I heard them say 'Police,' so I let them
have it."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 471px;">
<img src="images/gs03.png" width="471" height="400" alt="THEY LAUGHED EVER SO." title="THEY LAUGHED EVER SO." />
<span class="caption">THEY LAUGHED EVER SO.</span>
</div>

<p>"What <i>did</i> you do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I just kicked about in the basket, and
I heard them all start off, and I shouted, 'Hi,
here! let me out, can't you!'"</p>

<p>"And did they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not for ever so long, I had to
jaw at them through the cracks of the basket.
And when they opened it there was quite a
crowd, and they laughed ever so, and gave me
bread and cheese, and said I was a plucky
youngster&mdash;and I am, and I do wish Father
wouldn't put things off so. He might just as
well have spoken to me this morning. And
I can't see I've done anything so awful&mdash;and
it's all your faults for not looking after me.
Aren't I your little brother? and it's your duty
to see I do what's right. You've told me so
often enough."</p>

<p>These last words checked the severe reprimand
trembling on the hitherto patient
Oswald's lips. And then H.O. began to cry,
and Dora nursed him, though generally he is
much too big for this and knows it. And he
went to sleep on her lap, and said he didn't
want any dinner.</p>

<p>When it came to Father's speaking to H.O.
that evening it never came off, because H.O.
was ill in bed, not sham, you know, but real,
send-for-the-doctor ill. The doctor said it was
fever from chill and excitement, but I think
myself it was very likely the things he ate at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
lunch, and the shaking up, and then the
bread and cheese, and the beer out of a can.</p>

<p>He was ill a week. When he was better,
not much was said. My Father, who is the
justest man in England, said the boy had been
punished enough&mdash;and so he had, for he
missed going to the pantomime, and to
"Shock-Headed Peter" at the Garrick Theatre,
which is far and away the best play that ever
was done, and quite different from any other
acting I ever saw. They are exactly like real
boys; I think they must have been reading
about us. And he had to take a lot of the
filthiest medicine I ever tasted. I wonder if
Father told the doctor to make it nasty on
purpose? A woman would have directly, but
gentlemen are not generally so sly. Any way,
you live and learn. None of us would now
ever consent to be a stowaway, no matter who
wanted us to, and I don't think H.O.'s very
likely to do it again.</p>

<p>The only <i>meant</i> punishment he had was
seeing the clown's dress burnt before his eyes
by Father. He had bought it all with his own
saved-up money, red trimmings and all.</p>

<p>Of course, when he got well we soon taught
him not to say again that it was any of our
faults. As he owned himself, he <i>is</i> our little
brother, and we are not going to stand that
kind of cheek from <i>him</i>.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE CONSCIENCE-PUDDING</i></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> was Christmas, nearly a year after Mother
died. I cannot write about Mother&mdash;but I
will just say one thing. If she had only been
away for a little while, and not for always,
we shouldn't have been so keen on having a
Christmas. I didn't understand this then,
but I am much older now, and I think it was
just because everything was so different and
horrid we felt we <i>must</i> do something; and
perhaps we were not particular enough <i>what</i>.
Things make you much more unhappy when
you loaf about than when you are doing
events.</div>

<p>Father had to go away just about Christmas.
He had heard that his wicked partner, who
ran away with his money, was in France,
and he thought he could catch him, but
really he was in Spain, where catching criminals
is never practised. We did not know
this till afterwards.</p>

<p>Before Father went away he took Dora
and Oswald into his study, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry I've got to go away,
but it is very serious business, and I must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
go. You'll be good while I'm away, kiddies,
won't you?"</p>

<p>We promised faithfully. Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are reasons&mdash;you wouldn't understand
if I tried to tell you&mdash;but you can't
have much of a Christmas this year. But
I've told Matilda to make you a good plain
pudding. Perhaps next Christmas will be
brighter."</p>

<p>(It was; for the next Christmas saw us the
affluent nephews and nieces of an Indian
uncle&mdash;but that is quite another story, as
good old Kipling says.)</p>

<p>When Father had been seen off at Lewisham
Station with his bags, and a plaid rug
in a strap, we came home again, and it was
horrid. There were papers and things littered
all over his room where he had packed. We
tidied the room up&mdash;it was the only thing we
could do for him. It was Dicky who accidentally
broke his shaving-glass, and H.O.
made a paper boat out of a letter we found
out afterwards Father particularly wanted to
keep. This took us some time, and when we
went into the nursery the fire was black out,
and we could not get it alight again, even with
the whole <i>Daily Chronicle</i>. Matilda, who was
our general then, was out, as well as the fire,
so we went and sat in the kitchen. There is
always a good fire in kitchens. The kitchen
hearthrug was not nice to sit on, so we spread
newspapers on it.</p>

<p>It was sitting in the kitchen, I think, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
brought to our minds my Father's parting
words&mdash;about the pudding, I mean.</p>

<p>Oswald said, "Father said we couldn't have
much of a Christmas for secret reasons, and
he said he had told Matilda to make us a plain
pudding."</p>

<p>The plain pudding instantly cast its shadow
over the deepening gloom of our young
minds.</p>

<p>"I wonder <i>how</i> plain she'll make it?" Dicky
said.</p>

<p>"As plain as plain, you may depend," said
Oswald. "A here-am-I-where-are-you pudding&mdash;that's
her sort."</p>

<p>The others groaned, and we gathered closer
round the fire till the newspapers rustled
madly.</p>

<p>"I believe I could make a pudding that
<i>wasn't</i> plain, if I tried," Alice said. "Why
shouldn't we?"</p>

<p>"No chink," said Oswald, with brief sadness.</p>

<p>"How much would it cost?" <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Noel'">No&euml;l</ins> asked,
and added that Dora had twopence and H.O.
had a French halfpenny.</p>

<p>Dora got the cookery-book out of the dresser
drawer, where it lay doubled up among clothes-pegs,
dirty dusters, scallop shells, string, penny
novelettes, and the dining-room corkscrew.
The general we had then&mdash;it seemed as if she
did all the cooking on the cookery-book
instead of on the baking-board, there were
traces of so many bygone meals upon its
pages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"It doesn't say Christmas pudding at all,"
said Dora.</p>

<p>"Try plum," the resourceful Oswald instantly
counselled.</p>

<p>Dora turned the greasy pages anxiously.</p>

<p>"'Plum-pudding, 518.</p>

<p>"'A rich, with flour, 517.</p>

<p>"'Christmas, 517.</p>

<p>"'Cold brandy sauce for, 241.'</p>

<p>"We shouldn't care about that, so it's no
use looking.</p>

<p>"'Good without eggs, 518.</p>

<p>"'Plain, 518.'</p>

<p>"We don't want <i>that</i> anyhow. 'Christmas,
517'&mdash;that's the one."</p>

<p>It took her a long time to find the page.
Oswald got a shovel of coals and made up the
fire. It blazed up like the devouring elephant
the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> always calls it. Then
Dora read&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Christmas plum-pudding. Time six hours.'"</p>

<p>"To eat it in?" said H.O.</p>

<p>"No, silly! to make it."</p>

<p>"Forge ahead, Dora," Dicky replied.</p>

<p>Dora went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"'2072. One pound and a half of raisins;
half a pound of currants; three quarters of a
pound of breadcrumbs; half a pound of flour;
three-quarters of a pound of beef suet; nine
eggs; one wine glassful of brandy; half a
pound of citron and orange peel; half a
nutmeg; and a little ground ginger.' I wonder
<i>how</i> little ground ginger."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"A teacupful would be enough, I think,"
Alice said; "we must not be extravagant."</p>

<p>"We haven't got anything yet to be extravagant
<i>with</i>," said Oswald, who had toothache
that day. "What would you do with the
things if you'd got them?"</p>

<p>"You'd 'chop the suet as fine as possible'&mdash;I
wonder how fine that is?" replied Dora and
the book together&mdash;"'and mix it with the
breadcrumbs and flour; add the currants
washed and dried.'"</p>

<p>"Not starched, then," said Alice.</p>

<p>"'The citron and orange peel cut into thin
slices'&mdash;I wonder what they call thin?
Matilda's thin bread-and-butter is quite
different from what I mean by it&mdash;'and the
raisins stoned and divided.' How many heaps
would you divide them into?"</p>

<p>"Seven, I suppose," said Alice; "one for each
person and one for the pot&mdash;I mean pudding."</p>

<p>"'Mix it all well together with the grated
nutmeg and ginger. Then stir in nine eggs
well beaten, and the brandy'&mdash;we'll leave that
out, I think&mdash;'and again mix it thoroughly
together that every ingredient may be
moistened; put it into a buttered mould, tie
over tightly, and boil for six hours. Serve it
ornamented with holly and brandy poured
over it.'"</p>

<p>"I should think holly and brandy poured
over it would be simply beastly," said Dicky.</p>

<p>"I expect the book knows. I daresay holly
and water would do as well though. 'This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
pudding may be made a month before'&mdash;it's no
use reading about that though, because we've
only got four days to Christmas."</p>

<p>"It's no use reading about any of it,"
said Oswald, with thoughtful repeatedness,
"because we haven't got the things, and we
haven't got the coin to get them."</p>

<p>"We might get the tin somehow," said
Dicky.</p>

<p>"There must be lots of kind people who
would subscribe to a Christmas pudding for
poor children who hadn't any," No&euml;l said.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going skating at Penn's," said
Oswald. "It's no use thinking about puddings.
We must put up with it plain."</p>

<p>So he went, and Dicky went with him.</p>

<p>When they returned to their home in the
evening the fire had been lighted again in the
nursery, and the others were just having tea.
We toasted our bread-and-butter on the bare
side, and it gets a little warm among the
butter. This is called French toast. "I like
English better, but it is more expensive,"
Alice said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Matilda is in a frightful rage about your
putting those coals on the kitchen fire, Oswald.
She says we shan't have enough to last over
Christmas as it is. And Father gave her a
talking to before he went about them&mdash;asked
her if she ate them, she says&mdash;but I don't
believe he did. Anyway, she's locked the coal-cellar
door, and she's got the key in her pocket.
I don't see how we can boil the pudding."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"What pudding?" said Oswald dreamily.
He was thinking of a chap he had seen at
Penn's who had cut the date 1899 on the ice
with four strokes.</p>

<p>"<i>The</i> pudding," Alice said. "Oh, we've had
such a time, Oswald! First Dora and I went to
the shops to find out exactly what the pudding
would cost&mdash;it's only two and elevenpence
halfpenny, counting in the holly."</p>

<p>"It's no good," Oswald repeated; he is very
patient and will say the same thing any number
of times. "It's no good. You know we've
got no tin."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Alice, "but No&euml;l and I went out,
and we called at some of the houses in Granville
Park and Dartmouth Hill&mdash;and we got a
lot of sixpences and shillings, besides pennies,
and one old gentleman gave us half-a-crown.
He was so nice. Quite bald, with a knitted
red and blue waistcoat. We've got eight-and-sevenpence."</p>

<p>Oswald did not feel quite sure Father would
like us to go asking for shillings and sixpences,
or even half-crowns from strangers,
but he did not say so. The money had been
asked for and got, and it couldn't be helped&mdash;and
perhaps he wanted the pudding&mdash;I am not
able to remember exactly why he did not speak
up and say, "This is wrong," but anyway he
didn't.</p>

<p>Alice and Dora went out and bought the
things next morning. They bought double
quantities, so that it came to five shillings and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
elevenpence, and was enough to make a
noble pudding. There was a lot of holly left
over for decorations. We used very little for
the sauce. The money that was left we spent
very anxiously in other things to eat, such as
dates and figs and toffee.</p>

<p>We did not tell Matilda about it. She was
a red-haired girl, and apt to turn shirty at the
least thing.</p>

<p>Concealed under our jackets and overcoats
we carried the parcels up to the nursery, and
hid them in the treasure-chest we had there.
It was the bureau drawer. It was locked up
afterwards because the treacle got all over the
green baize and the little drawers inside it while
we were waiting to begin to make the pudding.
It was the grocer told us we ought to put
treacle in the pudding, and also about not so
much ginger as a teacupful.</p>

<p>When Matilda had begun to pretend to
scrub the floor (she pretended this three times
a week so as to have an excuse not to let us
in the kitchen, but I know she used to read
novelettes most of the time, because Alice and
I had a squint through the window more than
once), we barricaded the nursery door and set
to work. We were very careful to be quite
clean. We washed our hands as well as the
currants. I have sometimes thought we did
not get all the soap off the currants. The
pudding smelt like a washing-day when
the time came to cut it open. And we
washed a corner of the table to chop the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
suet on. Chopping suet looks easy till you
try.</p>

<p>Father's machine he weighs letters with
did to weigh out the things. We did this very
carefully, in case the grocer had not done
so. Everything was right except the raisins.
H.O. had carried them home. He was very
young then, and there was a hole in the
corner of the paper bag and his mouth was
sticky.</p>

<p>Lots of people have been hanged to a
gibbet in chains on evidence no worse than
that, and we told H.O. so till he cried. This
was good for him. It was not unkindness to
H.O., but part of our duty.</p>

<p>Chopping suet as fine as possible is much
harder than any one would think, as I said
before. So is crumbling bread&mdash;especially
if your loaf is new, like ours was. When
we had done them the breadcrumbs and the
suet were both very large and lumpy, and of
a dingy gray colour, something like pale slate
pencil.</p>

<p>They looked a better colour when we had
mixed them with the flour. The girls had
washed the currants with Brown Windsor
soap and the sponge. Some of the currants
got inside the sponge and kept coming out
in the bath for days afterwards. I see now
that this was not quite nice. We cut the
candied peel as thin as we wish people would
cut our bread-and-butter. We tried to take
the stones out of the raisins, but they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
too sticky, so we just divided them up in
seven lots. Then we mixed the other things
in the wash-hand basin from the spare bedroom
that was always spare. We each put
in our own lot of raisins and turned it all
into a pudding-basin, and tied it up in one
of Alice's pinafores, which was the nearest
thing to a proper pudding-cloth we could
find&mdash;at any rate clean. What was left
sticking to the wash-hand basin did not taste
so bad.</p>

<p>"It's a little bit soapy," Alice said, "but
perhaps that will boil out; like stains in
table-cloths."</p>

<p>It was a difficult question how to boil the
pudding. Matilda proved furious when asked
to let us, just because some one had happened
to knock her hat off the scullery door and
Pincher had got it and done for it. However,
part of the embassy nicked a saucepan while
the others were being told what Matilda
thought about the hat, and we got hot water
out of the bath-room and made it boil over
our nursery fire. We put the pudding in&mdash;it
was now getting on towards the hour of
tea&mdash;and let it boil. With some exceptions&mdash;owing
to the fire going down, and Matilda not
hurrying up with coals&mdash;it boiled for an hour
and a quarter. Then Matilda came suddenly
in and said, "I'm not going to have you
messing about in here with my saucepans";
and she tried to take it off the fire. You will
see that we couldn't stand this; it was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
likely. I do not remember who it was that
told her to mind her own business, and I
think I have forgotten who caught hold of
her first to make her chuck it. I am sure no
needless violence was used. Anyway, while
the struggle progressed, Alice and Dora took
the saucepan away and put it in the boot-cupboard
under the stairs and put the key in
their pocket.</p>

<p>This sharp encounter made every one very
hot and cross. We got over it before Matilda
did, but we brought her round before bedtime.
Quarrels should always be made up
before bedtime. It says so in the Bible. If
this simple rule was followed there would not
be so many wars and martyrs and law suits
and inquisitions and bloody deaths at the
stake.</p>

<p>All the house was still. The gas was out
all over the house except on the first landing,
when several darkly-shrouded figures might
have been observed creeping downstairs to
the kitchen.</p>

<p>On the way, with superior precaution, we
got out our saucepan. The kitchen fire was
red, but low; the coal-cellar was locked, and
there was nothing in the scuttle but a little
coal-dust and the piece of brown paper that is
put in to keep the coals from tumbling out
through the bottom where the hole is. We
put the saucepan on the fire and plied it with
fuel&mdash;two <i>Chronicles</i>, a <i>Telegraph</i>, and two
<i>Family Herald</i> novelettes were burned in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
vain. I am almost sure the pudding did not
boil at all that night.</p>

<p>"Never mind," Alice said. "We can each
nick a piece of coal every time we go into the
kitchen to-morrow."</p>

<p>This daring scheme was faithfully performed,
and by night we had nearly half a
waste-paper basket of coal, coke, and cinders.
And in the depth of night once more we
might have been observed, this time with our
collier-like waste-paper basket in our guarded
hands.</p>

<p>There was more fire left in the grate that
night, and we fed it with the fuel we had
collected. This time the fire blazed up, and
the pudding boiled like mad. This was the
time it boiled two hours&mdash;at least I think it
was about that, but we dropped asleep on the
kitchen tables and dresser. You dare not be
lowly in the night in the kitchen, because of
the beetles. We were aroused by a horrible
smell. It was the pudding-cloth burning. All
the water had secretly boiled itself away.
We filled it up at once with cold, and the
saucepan cracked. So we cleaned it and put
it back on the shelf and took another and
went to bed. You see what a lot of trouble
we had over the pudding. Every evening till
Christmas, which had now become only the
day after to-morrow, we sneaked down in the
inky midnight and boiled that pudding for as
long as it would.</p>

<p>On Christmas morning we chopped the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
holly for the sauce, but we put hot water
(instead of brandy) and moist sugar. Some
of them said it was not so bad. Oswald was
not one of these.</p>

<p>Then came the moment when the plain
pudding Father had ordered smoked upon the
board. Matilda brought it in and went away
at once. She had a cousin out of Woolwich
Arsenal to see her that day, I remember.
Those far-off days are quite distinct in
memory's recollection still.</p>

<p>Then we got out our own pudding from its
hiding-place and gave it one last hurried boil&mdash;only
seven minutes, because of the general
impatience which Oswald and Dora could not
cope with.</p>

<p>We had found means to secrete a dish, and
we now tried to dish the pudding up, but it
stuck to the basin, and had to be dislodged
with the chisel. The pudding was horribly
pale. We poured the holly sauce over it, and
Dora took up the knife and was just cutting
it when a few simple words from H.O. turned
us from happy and triumphing cookery artists
to persons in despair.</p>

<p>He said: "How pleased all those kind ladies
and gentlemen would be if they knew <i>we</i> were
the poor children they gave the shillings and
sixpences and things for!"</p>

<p>We all said, "<i>What?</i>" It was no moment
for politeness.</p>

<p>"I say," H.O. said, "they'd be glad if
they knew it was us was enjoying the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
pudding, and not dirty little, really poor
children."</p>

<p>"You should say 'you were,' not 'you was,'"
said Dora, but it was as in a dream and only
from habit.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say"&mdash;Oswald spoke firmly,
yet not angrily&mdash;"that you and Alice went
and begged for money for poor children, and
then <i>kept</i> it?"</p>

<p>"We didn't keep it," said H.O., "we
spent it."</p>

<p>"We've kept the <i>things</i>, you little duffer!"
said Dicky, looking at the pudding sitting
alone and uncared for on its dish. "You
begged for money for poor children, and then
<i>kept</i> it. It's stealing, that's what it is. I
don't say so much about you&mdash;you're only a
silly kid&mdash;but Alice knew better. Why did
you do it?"</p>

<p>He turned to Alice, but she was now too
deep in tears to get a word out.</p>

<p>H.O. looked a bit frightened, but he
answered the question. We have taught
him this. He said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thought they'd give us more if I said
poor children than if I said just us."</p>

<p>"<i>That's</i> cheating," said Dicky&mdash;"downright
beastly, mean, low cheating."</p>

<p>"I'm not," said H.O.; "and you're another."
Then he began to cry too. I do not know
how the others felt, but I understand from
Oswald that he felt that now the honour of
the house of Bastable had been stamped on in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the dust, and it didn't matter what happened.
He looked at the beastly holly that had been
left over from the sauce and was stuck up
over the pictures. It now appeared hollow
and disgusting, though it had got quite a lot
of berries, and some of it was the varied kind&mdash;green
and white. The figs and dates and
toffee were set out in the doll's dinner service.
The very sight of it all made Oswald blush
sickly. He owns he would have liked to cuff
H.O., and, if he did for a moment wish to
shake Alice, the author, for one, can make
allowances.</p>

<p>Now Alice choked and spluttered, and wiped
her eyes fiercely, and said, "It's no use ragging
H.O. It's my fault. I'm older than he is."</p>

<p>H.O. said, "It couldn't be Alice's fault. I
don't see as it was wrong."</p>

<p>"That, not as," murmured Dora, putting her
arm round the sinner who had brought this
degrading blight upon our family tree, but
such is girls' undetermined and affectionate
silliness. "Tell sister all about it, H.O. dear.
Why couldn't it be Alice's fault?"</p>

<p>H.O. cuddled up to Dora and said
snufflingly in his nose&mdash;</p>

<p>"Because she hadn't got nothing to do with
it. I collected it all. She never went into
one of the houses. She didn't want to."</p>

<p>"And then took all the credit of getting the
money," said Dicky savagely.</p>

<p>Oswald said, "Not much <i>credit</i>," in scornful
tones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you are <i>beastly</i>, the whole lot of you,
except Dora!" Alice said, stamping her foot in
rage and despair. "I tore my frock on a nail
going out, and I didn't want to go back, and I
got H.O. to go to the houses alone, and I
waited for him outside. And I asked him not
to say anything because I didn't want Dora to
know about the frock&mdash;it's my best. And I
don't know what he said inside. He never
told me. But I'll bet anything he didn't <i>mean</i>
to cheat."</p>

<p>"You <i>said</i> lots of kind people would be
ready to give money to get pudding for poor
children. So I asked them to."</p>

<p>Oswald, with his strong right hand, waved a
wave of passing things over.</p>

<p>"We'll talk about that another time," he
said; "just now we've got weightier things to
deal with."</p>

<p>He pointed to the pudding, which had
grown cold during the conversation to
which I have alluded. H.O. stopped crying,
but Alice went on with it. Oswald now
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We're a base and outcast family. Until
that pudding's out of the house we shan't be
able to look any one in the face. We must
see that that pudding goes to poor children&mdash;not
grisling, grumpy, whiney-piney, pretending
poor children&mdash;but real poor ones, just as
poor as they can stick."</p>

<p>"And the figs too&mdash;and the dates," said No&euml;l,
with regretting tones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Every fig," said Dicky sternly. "Oswald
is quite right."</p>

<p>This honourable resolution made us feel a
bit better. We hastily put on our best things,
and washed ourselves a bit, and hurried out to
find some really poor people to give the pudding
to. We cut it in slices ready, and put it
in a basket with the figs and dates and toffee.
We would not let H.O. come with us at first
because he wanted to. And Alice would not
come because of him. So at last we had to let
him. The excitement of tearing into your
best things heals the hurt that wounded
honour feels, as the poetry writer said&mdash;or at
any rate it makes the hurt feel better.</p>

<p>We went out into the streets. They were
pretty quiet&mdash;nearly everybody was eating its
Christmas dessert. But presently we met a
woman in an apron. Oswald said very
politely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please, are you a poor person?" And she
told us to get along with us.</p>

<p>The next we met was a shabby man with a
hole in his left boot.</p>

<p>Again Oswald said, "Please, are you a poor
person, and have you any poor little children?"</p>

<p>The man told us not to come any of our
games with him, or we should laugh on the
wrong side of our faces. We went on sadly.
We had no heart to stop and explain to him
that we had no games to come.</p>

<p>The next was a young man near the Obelisk.
Dora tried this time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>She said, "Oh, if you please we've got some
Christmas pudding in this basket, and if
you're a poor person you can have some."</p>

<p>"Poor as Job," said the young man in a
hoarse voice, and he had to come up out of a
red comforter to say it.</p>

<p>We gave him a slice of the pudding, and he
bit into it without thanks or delay. The next
minute he had thrown the pudding slap in
Dora's face, and was clutching Dicky by the
collar.</p>

<p>"Blime if I don't chuck ye in the river, the
whole bloomin' lot of you!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The girls screamed, the boys shouted, and
though Oswald threw himself on the insulter
of his sister with all his manly vigour, yet but
for a friend of Oswald's, who is in the police,
passing at that instant, the author shudders
to think what might have happened, for he
was a strong young man, and Oswald is not
yet come to his full strength, and the Quaggy
runs all too near.</p>

<p>Our policeman led our assailant aside, and
we waited anxiously, as he told us to. After
long uncertain moments the young man in
the comforter loafed off grumbling, and our
policeman turned to us.</p>

<p>"Said you give him a dollop o' pudding, and
it tasted of soap and hair-oil."</p>

<p>I suppose the hair-oil must have been the
Brown Windsoriness of the soap coming out.
We were sorry, but it was still our duty to get
rid of the pudding. The Quaggy was handy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
it is true, but when you have collected money
to feed poor children and spent it on pudding
it is not right to throw that pudding in the
river. People do not subscribe shillings and
sixpences and half-crowns to feed a hungry
flood with Christmas pudding.</p>

<p>Yet we shrank from asking any more
people whether they were poor persons, or
about their families, and still more from
offering the pudding to chance people who
might bite into it and taste the soap before
we had time to get away.</p>

<p>It was Alice, the most paralysed with
disgrace of all of us, who thought of the
best idea.</p>

<p>She said, "Let's take it to the workhouse.
At any rate they're all poor people there, and
they mayn't go out without leave, so they
can't run after us to do anything to us after
the pudding. No one would give them leave
to go out to pursue people who had brought
them pudding, and wreck vengeance on them,
and at any rate we shall get rid of the conscience-pudding&mdash;it's
a sort of conscience-money,
you know&mdash;only it isn't money but
pudding."</p>

<p>The workhouse is a good way, but we stuck
to it, though very cold, and hungrier than we
thought possible when we started, for we had
been so agitated we had not even stayed to
eat the plain pudding our good Father had so
kindly and thoughtfully ordered for our
Christmas dinner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The big bell at the workhouse made a man
open the door to us, when we rang it. Oswald
said (and he spoke because he is next eldest to
Dora, and she had had jolly well enough of
saying anything about pudding)&mdash;he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please we've brought some pudding for
the poor people."</p>

<p>He looked us up and down, and he looked
at our basket, then he said: "You'd better see
the Matron."</p>

<p>We waited in a hall, feeling more and more
uncomfy, and less and less like Christmas.
We were very cold indeed, especially our
hands and our noses. And we felt less and
less able to face the Matron if she was horrid,
and one of us at least wished we had chosen
the Quaggy for the pudding's long home, and
made it up to the robbed poor in some other
way afterwards.</p>

<p>Just as Alice was saying earnestly in the
burning cold ear of Oswald, "Let's put down
the basket and make a bolt for it. Oh, Oswald,
<i>let's!</i>" a lady came along the passage. She
was very upright, and she had eyes that went
through you like blue gimlets. I should not
like to be obliged to thwart that lady if she
had any design, and mine was opposite. I am
glad this is not likely to occur.</p>

<p>She said, "What's all this about a pudding?"</p>

<p>H.O. said at once, before we could stop him,
"They say I've stolen the pudding, so we've
brought it here for the poor people."</p>

<p>"No, we didn't!" "That wasn't why!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
"The money was given!" "It was meant
for the poor!" "Shut up, H.O.!" said the
rest of us all at once.</p>

<p>Then there was an awful silence. The lady
gimleted us again one by one with her blue
eyes.</p>

<p>Then she said: "Come into my room. You
all look frozen."</p>

<p>She took us into a very jolly room with
velvet curtains and a big fire, and the gas
lighted, because now it was almost dark, even
out of doors. She gave us chairs, and Oswald
felt as if his was a dock, he felt so criminal,
and the lady looked so Judgular.</p>

<p>Then she took the arm-chair by the fire
herself, and said, "Who's the eldest?"</p>

<p>"I am," said Dora, looking more like a
frightened white rabbit than I've ever seen
her.</p>

<p>"Then tell me all about it."</p>

<p>Dora looked at Alice and began to cry.
That slab of pudding in the face had totally
unnerved the gentle girl. Alice's eyes were
red, and her face was puffy with crying; but
she spoke up for Dora and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, please let Oswald tell. Dora can't.
She's tired with the long walk. And a young
man threw a piece of it in her face, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lady nodded and Oswald began. He
told the story from the very beginning, as he
has always been taught to, though he hated
to lay bare the family honour's wound before
a stranger, however judgelike and gimlet-eyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
He told all&mdash;not concealing the pudding-throwing,
nor what the young man said
about soap.</p>

<p>"So," he ended, "we want to give the conscience-pudding
to you. It's like conscience-money&mdash;you
know what that is, don't you?
But if you really think it is soapy and not
just the young man's horridness, perhaps
you'd better not let them eat it. But the
figs and things are all right."</p>

<p>When he had done the lady said, for most
of us were crying more or less&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, cheer up! It's Christmas-time, and
he's very little&mdash;your brother, I mean. And I
think the rest of you seem pretty well able
to take care of the honour of the family.
I'll take the conscience-pudding off your
minds. Where are you going now?"</p>

<p>"Home, I suppose," Oswald said. And he
thought how nasty and dark and dull it
would be. The fire out most likely and
Father away.</p>

<p>"And your Father's not at home, you say,"
the blue-gimlet lady went on. "What do you
say to having tea with me, and then seeing
the entertainment we have got up for our
old people?"</p>

<p>Then the lady smiled and the blue gimlets
looked quite merry.</p>

<p>The room was so warm and comfortable
and the invitation was the last thing we
expected. It was jolly of her, I do think.</p>

<p>No one thought quite at first of saying how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
pleased we should be to accept her kind
invitation. Instead we all just said "Oh!"
but in a tone which must have told her we
meant "Yes, please," very deeply.</p>

<p>Oswald (this has more than once happened)
was the first to restore his manners. He
made a proper bow like he has been taught,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. We should like
it very much. It is very much nicer than
going home. Thank you very much."</p>

<p>I need not tell the reader that Oswald could
have made up a much better speech if he had
had more time to make it up in, or if he had
not been so filled with mixed flusteredness
and furification by the shameful events of the
day.</p>

<p>We washed our faces and hands and had a
first rate muffin and crumpet tea, with slices
of cold meats, and many nice jams and cakes.
A lot of other people were there, most of
them people who were giving the entertainment
to the aged poor.</p>

<p>After tea it was the entertainment. Songs
and conjuring and a play called "Box and
Cox," very amusing, and a lot of throwing
things about in it&mdash;bacon and chops and
things&mdash;and nigger minstrels. We clapped
till our hands were sore.</p>

<p>When it was over we said goodbye. In
between the songs and things Oswald had
had time to make up a speech of thanks to
the lady.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>He said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We all thank you heartily for your goodness.
The entertainment was beautiful. We
shall never forget your kindness and hospitableness."</p>

<p>The lady laughed, and said she had been
very pleased to have us. A fat gentleman
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"And your teas? I hope you enjoyed those&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>Oswald had not had time to make up an
answer to that, so he answered straight from
the heart, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ra&mdash;<i>ther!</i>"</p>

<p>And every one laughed and slapped us boys
on the back and kissed the girls, and the
gentleman who played the bones in the nigger
minstrels saw us home. We ate the cold pudding
that night, and H.O. dreamed that something
came to eat him, like it advises you to
in the advertisements on the hoardings. The
grown-ups said it was the pudding, but I don't
think it could have been that, because, as I
have said more than once, it was so very
plain.</p>

<p>Some of H.O.'s brothers and sisters thought
it was a judgment on him for pretending
about who the poor children were he was
collecting the money for. Oswald does not
believe such a little boy as H.O. would have
a real judgment made just for him and nobody
else, whatever he did.</p>

<p>But it certainly is odd. H.O. was the only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
one who had bad dreams, and he was also the
only one who got any of the things we bought
with that ill-gotten money, because, you remember,
he picked a hole in the raisin-paper
as he was bringing the parcel home. The rest of
us had nothing, unless you count the scrapings
of the pudding-basin, and those don't really
count at all.</p>

<h2><i>ARCHIBALD THE UNPLEASANT</i></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> house of Bastable was once in poor, but
honest, circs. That was when it lived in a
semi-detached house in the Lewisham Road,
and looked for treasure. There were six
scions of the house who looked for it&mdash;in
fact there were seven, if you count Father.
I am sure he looked right enough, but he
did not do it the right way. And we did.
And so we found a treasure of a great-uncle,
and we and Father went to live with him in a
very affluent mansion on Blackheath&mdash;with
gardens and vineries and pineries and everything
jolly you can think of. And then, when
we were no longer so beastly short of pocket-money,
we tried to be good, and sometimes
it came out right, and sometimes it didn't.
Something like sums.</div>

<p>And then it was the Christmas holidays&mdash;and
we had a bazaar and raffled the most
beautiful goat you ever saw, and we gave
the money to the poor and needy.</p>

<p>And then we felt it was time to do something
new, because we were as rich as our worthy
relative, the uncle, and our Father&mdash;now also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
wealthy, at least, compared to what he used to
be&mdash;thought right for us; and we were as
good as we could be without being good for
nothing and muffs, which I hope no one
calling itself a Bastable will ever stoop to.</p>

<p>So then Oswald, so often the leader in
hazardous enterprises, thought long and
deeply in his interior self, and he saw that
something must be done, because, though
there was still the goat left over, unclaimed
by its fortunate winner at the Bazaar,
somehow no really fine idea seemed to come
out of it, and nothing else was happening.
Dora was getting a bit domineering, and
Alice was too much taken up with trying
to learn to knit. Dicky was bored and so
was Oswald, and No&euml;l was writing far more
poetry than could be healthy for any poet,
however young, and H.O. was simply a
nuisance. His boots are always much louder
when he is not amused, and that gets the rest
of us into rows, because there are hardly any
grown-up persons who can tell the difference
between his boots and mine. Oswald decided
to call a council (because even if nothing comes
of a council it always means getting Alice to
drop knitting, and making No&euml;l chuck the
poetical influences, that are no use and
only make him silly), and he went into
the room that is our room. It is called the
common-room, like in colleges, and it is very
different from the room that was ours when
we were poor, but honest. It is a jolly room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
with a big table and a big couch, that is most
useful for games, and a thick carpet because
of H.O.'s boots.</p>

<p>Alice was knitting by the fire; it was for
Father, but I am sure his feet are not at all
that shape. He has a high and beautifully
formed instep like Oswald's. No&euml;l was writing
poetry, of course.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"My dear sister sits<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And knits,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I hope to goodness the stocking fits,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>was as far as he had got.</div>

<p>"It ought to be 'my dearest sister' to sound
right," he said, "but that wouldn't be kind to
Dora."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Dora, "You needn't
trouble to be kind to me, if you don't
want to."</p>

<p>"Shut up, Dora!" said Dicky, "No&euml;l didn't
mean anything."</p>

<p>"He never does," said H.O., "nor yet his
poetry doesn't neither."</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> his poetry doesn't <i>either</i>," Dora
corrected; "and besides, you oughtn't to say
that at all, it's unkind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're too jolly down on the kid," said
Dicky.</p>

<p>And Alice said, "Eighty-seven, eighty-eight&mdash;oh,
do be quiet half a sec.!&mdash;eighty-nine,
ninety&mdash;now I shall have to count the stitches
all over again!"</p>

<p>Oswald alone was silent and not cross.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
I tell you this to show that the sort of
worryingness was among us that is catching,
like measles. Kipling calls it the cameelious
hump, and, as usual, that great and good
writer is quite correct.</p>

<p>So Oswald said, "Look here, let's have a
council. It says in Kipling's book when
you've got the hump go and dig till you
gently perspire. Well, we can't do that,
because it's simply pouring, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The others all interrupted him, and said
they hadn't got the hump and they didn't
know what he meant. So he shrugged his
shoulders patiently (it is not his fault that
the others hate him to shrug his shoulders
patiently) and he said no more.</p>

<p>Then Dora said, "Oh, don't be so disagreeable,
Oswald, for goodness' sake!"</p>

<p>I assure you she did, though he had done
simply nothing.</p>

<p>Matters were in this cryptical state when
the door opened and Father came in.</p>

<p>"Hullo, kiddies!" he remarked kindly.
"Beastly wet day, isn't it? And dark too.
I can't think why the rain can't always come
in term time. It seems a poor arrangement
to have it in 'vac.,' doesn't it?"</p>

<p>I think every one instantly felt better. I
know one of us did, and it was me.</p>

<p>Father lit the gas, and sat down in the
armchair and took Alice on his knee.</p>

<p>"First," he said, "here is a box of chocs."
It was an extra big and beautiful one and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Fuller's best. "And besides the chocs., a
piece of good news! You're all asked to
a party at Mrs. Leslie's. She's going to
have all sorts of games and things, with
prizes for every one, and a conjurer and a
magic lantern."</p>

<p>The shadow of doom seemed to be lifted
from each young brow, and we felt how
much fonder we were of each other than
any one would have thought. At least Oswald
felt this, and Dicky told me afterwards he felt
Dora wasn't such a bad sort after all.</p>

<p>"It's on Tuesday week," said Father. "I see
the prospect pleases. Number three is that
your cousin Archibald has come here to stay
a week or two. His little sister has taken it
into her head to have whooping-cough. And
he's downstairs now, talking to your uncle."</p>

<p>We asked what the young stranger was
like, but Father did not know, because he and
cousin Archibald's father had not seen much
of each other for some years. Father said
this, but we knew it was because Archibald's
father hadn't bothered to see ours when he
was poor and honest, but now he was the
wealthy sharer of the red-brick, beautiful
Blackheath house it was different. This
made us not like Uncle Archibald very much,
but we were too just to blame it on to young
Archibald. All the same we should have liked
him better if his father's previous career had
not been of such a worldly and stuck-up sort.
Besides, I do think Archibald is quite the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
rotten sort of name. We should have called
him Archie, of course, if he had been at all
decent.</p>

<p>"You'll be as jolly to him as you can, I
know," Father said; "he's a bit older than
you, Oswald. He's not a bad-looking chap."</p>

<p>Then Father went down and Oswald had to
go with him, and there was Archibald sitting
upright in a chair and talking to our Indian
uncle as if he was some beastly grown-up.
Our cousin proved to be dark and rather tall,
and though he was only fourteen he was
always stroking his lip to see if his moustache
had begun to come.</p>

<p>Father introduced us to each other, and we
said, "How do you do?" and looked at each
other, and neither of us could think of anything
else to say. At least Oswald couldn't.
So then we went upstairs. Archibald shook
hands with the others, and every one was
silent except Dora, and she only whispered to
H.O. to keep his feet still.</p>

<p>You cannot keep for ever in melancholy
silence however few things you have to say,
and presently some one said it was a wet day,
and this well-chosen remark made us able to
begin to talk.</p>

<p>I do not wish to be injurious to anybody,
especially one who was a Bastable, by birth
at least if not according to the nobler attributes,
but I must say that Oswald never did
dislike a boy so much as he did that young
Archibald. He was as cocky as though he'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
done something to speak of&mdash;been captain of
his eleven, or passed a beastly exam., or something&mdash;but
we never could find that he had
done anything. He was always bragging
about the things he had at home, and the
things he was allowed to do, and all the
things he knew all about, but he was a most
untruthful chap. He laughed at No&euml;l's being
a poet&mdash;a thing we never do, because it
makes him cry and crying makes him ill&mdash;and
of course Oswald and Dicky could not punch
his head in their own house because of the
laws of hospitableness, and Alice stopped it at
last by saying she didn't care if it was being a
sneak, she would tell Father the very next
time. I don't think she would have, because
we made a rule, when we were poor and
honest, not to bother Father if we could
possibly help it. And we keep it up still.
But Archibald didn't know that. Then this
cousin, who is, I fear, the black sheep of the
Bastables, and hardly worthy to be called one,
used to pull the girls' hair, and pinch them at
prayers when they could not call out or do
anything to him back.</p>

<p>And he was awfully rude to the servants,
ordering them about, and playing tricks on
them, not amusing tricks like other Bastables
might have done&mdash;such as booby-traps and
mice under dish-covers, which seldom leaves
any lasting ill-feeling&mdash;but things no decent
boy would do&mdash;like hiding their letters and
not giving them to them for days, and then it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
was too late to meet the young man the letter
was from, and squirting ink on their aprons
when they were just going to open the door,
and once he put a fish-hook in the cook's
pocket when she wasn't looking. He did not
do anything to Oswald at that time. I suppose
he was afraid. I just tell you this to
show you that Oswald didn't cotton to him
for no selfish reason, but because Oswald has
been taught to feel for others.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/gs04.png" width="339" height="400" alt="AND HE WAS AWFULLY RUDE TO THE SERVANTS." title="AND HE WAS AWFULLY RUDE TO THE SERVANTS." />
<span class="caption">AND HE WAS AWFULLY RUDE TO THE SERVANTS.</span>
</div>

<p>He called us all kids&mdash;and he was that kind
of boy we knew at once it was no good trying
to start anything new and jolly&mdash;so Oswald,
ever discreet and wary, shut up entirely about
the council. We played games with him
sometimes, not really good ones, but Snap
and Beggar my Neighbour, and even then he
used to cheat. I hate to say it of one of our
blood, but I can hardly believe he was. I
think he must have been changed at nurse
like the heirs to monarchies and dukeries.</p>

<p>Well, the days passed slowly. There was
Mrs. Leslie's party shining starrishly in the
mysteries of the future. Also we had another
thing to look forward to, and that was when
Archibald would have to go back to school.
But we could not enjoy that foreshadowing
so much because of us having to go back at
nearly the same time.</p>

<p>Oswald always tries to be just, no matter
how far from easy, and so I will say that I am
not quite sure that it was Archibald that set
the pipes leaking, but we were all up in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
loft the day before, snatching a golden opportunity
to play a brief game of robbers in a
cave, while Archibald had gone down to the
village to get his silly hair cut. Another
thing about him that was not natural was his
being always looking in the glass and wanting
to talk about whether people were handsome
or not; and he made as much fuss about his
ties as though he had been a girl. So when
he was gone Alice said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hist! The golden moment. Let's be
robbers in the loft, and when he comes back
he won't know where we are."</p>

<p>"He'll hear us," said No&euml;l, biting his pencil.</p>

<p>"No, he won't. We'll be the Whispering
Band of Weird Bandits. Come on, No&euml;l; you
can finish the poetry up here."</p>

<p>"It's about <i>him</i>," said No&euml;l gloomily, "when
he's gone back to&mdash;&mdash;" (Oswald will not give
the name of Archibald's school for the sake of
the other boys there, as they might not like
everybody who reads this to know about there
being a chap like him in their midst.) "I
shall do it up in an envelope and put a stamp
on it and post it to him, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haste!" cried Alice. "Bard of the Bandits,
haste while yet there's time."</p>

<p>So we tore upstairs and put on our slippers
and socks over them, and we got the high-backed
chair out of the girls' bedroom, and
the others held it steady while Oswald agilitively
mounted upon its high back and
opened the trap-door and got up into the place
between the roof and the ceiling (the boys in
"Stalky &amp; Co." found this out by accident,
and they were surprised and pleased, but we
have known all about it ever since we can
remember).</p>

<p>Then the others put the chair back, and
Oswald let down the rope ladder that we
made out of bamboo and clothes-line after
uncle told us the story of the missionary lady
who was shut up in a rajah's palace, and
some one shot an arrow to her with a string
tied to it, and it might have killed her I should
have thought, but it didn't, and she hauled in
the string and there was a rope and a bamboo
ladder, and so she escaped, and we made one
like it on purpose for the loft. No one had
ever told us not to make ladders.</p>

<p>The others came up by the rope-ladder (it
was partly bamboo, but rope-ladder does for
short) and we shut the trap-door down. It is
jolly up there. There are two big cisterns,
and one little window in a gable that gives
you just enough light. The floor is plaster
with wooden things going across, beams and
joists they are called. There are some planks
laid on top of these here and there. Of course
if you walk on the plaster you will go through
with your foot into the room below.</p>

<p>We had a very jolly game, in whispers, and
No&euml;l sat by the little window, and was quite
happy, being the bandit bard. The cisterns
are rocks you hide behind. But the jolliest
part was when we heard Archibald shouting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
out, "Hullo! kids, where are you?" and we all
stayed as still as mice, and heard Jane say she
thought we must have gone out. Jane was
the one that hadn't got her letter, as well as
having her apron inked all over.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/gs05.png" width="279" height="500" alt="THE OTHERS CAME UP BY THE ROPE-LADDER." title="THE OTHERS CAME UP BY THE ROPE-LADDER." />
<span class="caption">THE OTHERS CAME UP BY THE ROPE-LADDER.</span>
</div>

<p>Then we heard Archibald going all over the
house looking for us. Father was at business
and uncle was at his club. And we were
<i>there</i>. And so Archibald was all alone. And
we might have gone on for hours enjoying
the spectacle of his confusion and perplexedness,
but No&euml;l happened to sneeze&mdash;the least
thing gives him cold and he sneezes louder
for his age than any one I know&mdash;just when
Archibald was on the landing underneath.
Then he stood there and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know where you are. Let me come
up."</p>

<p>We cautiously did not reply. Then he said:</p>

<p>"All right. I'll go and get the step-ladder."</p>

<p>We did not wish this. We had not been
told not to make rope-ladders, nor yet about
not playing in the loft; but if he fetched the
step-ladder Jane would know, and there are
some secrets you like to keep to yourself.</p>

<p>So Oswald opened the trap-door and squinted
down, and there was that Archibald with his
beastly hair cut. Oswald said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We'll let you up if you promise not to tell
you've been up here."</p>

<p>So he promised, and we let down the rope-ladder.
And it will show you the kind of boy
he was that the instant he had got up by it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
he began to find fault with the way it was
made.</p>

</div>

<p>Then he wanted to play with the ball-cock.
But Oswald knows it is better not to do this.</p>

<p>"I daresay <i>you're</i> forbidden," Archibald said,
"little kids like you. But <i>I</i> know all about
plumbing."</p>

<p>And Oswald could not prevent his fiddling
with the pipes and the ball-cock a little. Then
we went down. All chance of further banditry
was at an end. Next day was Sunday.
The leak was noticed then. It was slow,
but steady, and the plumber was sent for
on Monday morning.</p>

<p>Oswald does not know whether it was Archibald
who made the leak, but he does know
about what came after.</p>

<p>I think our displeasing cousin found that
piece of poetry that No&euml;l was beginning
about him, and read it, because he is a
sneak. Instead of having it out with No&euml;l
he sucked up to him and gave him a six-penny
fountain-pen which No&euml;l liked, although
it is really no good for him to try to write
poetry with anything but a pencil, because
he always sucks whatever he writes with, and
ink is poisonous, I believe.</p>

<p>Then in the afternoon he and No&euml;l got quite
thick, and went off together. And afterwards
No&euml;l seemed very peacocky about
something, but he would not say what, and
Archibald was grinning in a way Oswald
would have liked to pound his head for.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, quite suddenly, the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'peacable'">peaceable</ins> quietness
of that happy Blackheath home was brought
to a close by screams. Servants ran about
with brooms and pails, and the water was
coming through the ceiling of uncle's room
like mad, and No&euml;l turned white and looked
at our unattractive cousin and said: "Send
him away."</p>

<p>Alice put her arm round No&euml;l and said:
"Do go, Archibald."</p>

<p>But he wouldn't.</p>

<p>So then No&euml;l said he wished he had never
been born, and whatever would Father say.</p>

<p>"Why, what is it, No&euml;l?" Alice asked that.
"Just tell us, we'll all stand by you. What's
he been doing?"</p>

<p>"You won't let him do anything to me if I
tell?"</p>

<p>"Tell tale tit," said Archibald.</p>

<p>"He got me to go up into the loft and he
said it was a secret, and would I promise not
to tell, and I won't tell; only I've done it, and
now the water's coming in."</p>

<p>"You've done it? You young ass, I was
only kidding you!" said our detestable cousin.
And he laughed.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said Oswald. "What
did you tell No&euml;l?"</p>

<p>"He can't tell you because he promised&mdash;and
I won't&mdash;unless you vow by the honour
of the house you talk so much about
that you'll never tell I had anything to do
with it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>That will show you what he was. We had
never mentioned the honour of the house
except once quite at the beginning, before we
knew how discapable he was of understanding
anything, and how far we were from
wanting to call him Archie.</p>

<p>We had to promise, for No&euml;l was getting
greener and more gurgly every minute, and at
any moment Father or uncle might burst in
foaming for an explanation, and none of us
would have one except No&euml;l, and him in this
state of all-anyhow.</p>

<p>So Dicky said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We promise, you beast, you!" And we all
said the same.</p>

<p>Then Archibald said, drawling his words
and feeling for the moustache that wasn't
there, and I hope he'll be quite old before he
gets one&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's just what comes of trying to amuse
silly little kids. I told the foolish little animal
about people having arteries cut, and your
having to cut the whole thing to stop the
bleeding. And he said, 'Was that what the
plumber would do to the leaky pipe?' And
how pleased your governor would be to find
it mended. And then he went and did it."</p>

<p>"You told me to," said No&euml;l, turning greener
and greener.</p>

<p>"Go along with Alice," said Oswald. "We'll
stand by you. And No&euml;l, old chap, you must
keep your word and not sneak about that
sneaking hound."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Alice took him away, and we were left with
the horrid Archibald.</p>

<p>"Now," said Oswald, "I won't break my
word, no more will the rest of us. But we
won't speak another word to you as long as
we live."</p>

<p>"Oh, Oswald," said Dora, "what about the
sun going down?"</p>

<p>"Let it jolly well go," said Dicky in furiousness.
"Oswald didn't say we'd go on being
angry for ever, but I'm with Oswald all the
way. I won't talk to cads&mdash;no, not even before
grown-ups. They can jolly well think what
they like."</p>

<p>After this no one spoke to Archibald.</p>

<p>Oswald rushed for a plumber, and such was
his fiery eloquence he really caught one and
brought him home. Then he and Dicky waited
for Father when he came in, and they got him
into the study, and Oswald said what they had
all agreed on. It was this:</p>

<p>"Father, we are all most awfully sorry, but
one of us has cut the pipe in the loft, and if
you make us tell you any more it will not be
honourable, and we are very sorry. Please,
please don't ask who it was did it."</p>

<p>Father bit his moustache and looked worried,
and Dicky went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oswald has got a plumber and he is doing
it now."</p>

<p>Then Father said, "How on earth did you
get into the loft?"</p>

<p>And then of course the treasured secret of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the rope-ladder had to be revealed. We had
never been told not to make rope-ladders and
go into the loft, but we did not try to soften
the anger of our Father by saying this. It
would not have been any good either. We
just had to stick it. And the punishment of
our crime was most awful. It was that we
weren't to go to Mrs. Leslie's party. And
Archibald was to go, because when Father
asked him if he was in it with the rest of
us, he said "No." I cannot think of any really
gentle, manly, and proper words to say what
I think about my unnatural cousin.</p>

<p>We kept our word about not speaking to
him, and I think Father thought we were
jealous because he was going to that conjuring,
magic lantern party and we were not.
No&euml;l was the most unhappy, because he knew
we were all being punished for what he had
done. He was very affectionate and tried to
write pieces of poetry to us all, but he was so
unhappy he couldn't even write, and he went
into the kitchen and sat on Jane's knee and
said his head ached.</p>

<p>Next day it was the day of the party and
we were plunged in gloom. Archibald got
out his Etons and put his clean shirt ready,
and a pair of flashy silk socks with red spots,
and then he went into the bath-room.</p>

<p>No&euml;l and Jane were whispering on the
stairs. Jane came up and No&euml;l went down,
Jane knocked at the bath-room door and
said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here's the soap, Master Archerbald. I
didn't put none in to-day."</p>

<p>He opened the door and put out his hand.</p>

<p>"Half a moment," said Jane, "I've got
something else in my hand."</p>

<p>As she spoke the gas all over the house
went down blue, and then went out. We
held our breaths heavily.</p>

<p>"Here it is," she said; "I'll put it in your
hand. I'll go down and turn off the burners
and see about the gas. You'll be late, sir. If
I was you I should get on a bit with the washing
of myself in the dark. I daresay the gas'll
be five or ten minutes, and it's five o'clock
now."</p>

<p>It wasn't, and of course she ought not to
have said it, but it was useful all the same.</p>

<p>No&euml;l came stumping up the stairs in the
dark. He fumbled about and then whispered,
"I've turned the little white china knob that
locks the bath-room door on the outside."</p>

<p>The water was bubbling and hissing in the
pipes inside, and the darkness went on.
Father and uncle had not come in yet, which
was a fortunate blessing.</p>

<p>"Do be quiet!" said No&euml;l. "Just you
wait."</p>

<p>We all sat on the stairs and waited. No&euml;l
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't ask me yet&mdash;you'll see&mdash;you wait."</p>

<p>And we waited, and the gas did not come
back.</p>

<p>At last Archibald tried to come out&mdash;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
thought he had washed himself clean, I suppose&mdash;and
of course the door was fastened.
He kicked and he hammered and he shouted,
and we were glad.</p>

<p>At last No&euml;l banged on the door and
screamed through the keyhole&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we let you out will you let us off
our promise not to tell about you and the
pipes? We won't tell till you've gone back
to school."</p>

<p>He wouldn't for a long time, but at last he
had to.</p>

<p>"I shan't ever come to your beastly house
again," he bellowed through the keyhole, "so
I don't mind."</p>

<p>"Turn off the gas-burners then," said Oswald,
ever thoughtful, though he was still
in ignorance of the beautiful truth.</p>

<p>Then No&euml;l sang out over the stairs, "Light
up!" and Jane went round with a taper, and
when the landing gas was lighted No&euml;l turned
the knob of the bath-room, and Archibald exited
in his Indian red and yellow dressing-gown
that he thought so much of. Of course we
expected his face to be red with rage, or white
with passion, or purple with mixed emotions,
but you cannot think what our feelings were&mdash;indeed,
we hardly knew what they were
ourselves&mdash;when we saw that he was not red
or white or purple, but <i>black</i>. He looked like
an uneven sort of bluish nigger. His face and
hands were all black and blue in streaks,
and so were the bits of his feet that showed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
between his Indian dressing-gown and his
Turkish slippers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">
<img src="images/gs07.png" width="453" height="400" alt="&quot;WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?&quot; HE ASKED. &quot;NYANG, NYANG!&quot; JANE ANSWERED TAUNTINGLY." title="&quot;WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?&quot; HE ASKED. &quot;NYANG, NYANG!&quot; JANE ANSWERED TAUNTINGLY." />
<span class="caption">&quot;WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?&quot; HE ASKED. &quot;NYANG, NYANG!&quot; JANE ANSWERED TAUNTINGLY.</span>
</div>

<p>The word "Krikey" fell from more than
one lip.</p>

<p>"What are you staring at?" he asked.</p>

<p>We did not answer even then, though I
think it was less from keep-your-wordishness
than amazement. But Jane did.</p>

<p>"Nyang, Nyang!" she uttered tauntingly.
"You thought it was soap I was giving you,
and all the time it was Maple's dark bright
navy-blue indelible dye&mdash;won't wash out."
She flashed a looking-glass in his face, and
he looked and saw the depth of his dark
bright navy-blueness.</p>

<p>Now, you may think that we shouted with
laughing to see him done brown and dyed blue
like this, but we did not. There was a spellbound
silence. Oswald, I know, felt a quite
uncomfortable feeling inside him.</p>

<p>When Archibald had had one good look at
himself he did not want any more. He ran to
his room and bolted himself in.</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> won't go to no parties," said Jane, and
she flounced downstairs.</p>

<p>We never knew how much No&euml;l had told
her. He is very young, and not so strong as
we are, and we thought it better not to ask.</p>

<p>Oswald and Dicky and H.O.&mdash;particularly
H.O.&mdash;told each other it served him right, but
after a bit Dora asked No&euml;l if he would mind
her trying to get some of it off our unloved
cousin, and he said "No."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/gs08.png" width="406" height="400" alt="WHEN FATHER CAME HOME THERE WAS AN AWFUL ROW." title="WHEN FATHER CAME HOME THERE WAS AN AWFUL ROW." />
<span class="caption">WHEN FATHER CAME HOME THERE WAS AN AWFUL ROW.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>But nothing would get it off him; and when
Father came home there was an awful row.
And he said we had disgraced ourselves and
forgotten the duties of hospitality. We got it
pretty straight, I can tell you. And we bore
it all. I do not say we were martyrs to the
honour of our house and to our plighted word,
but I do say that we got it very straight
indeed, and we did not tell the provocativeness
we had had from our guest that drove the
poet No&euml;l to this wild and desperate revenge.</p>

<p>But some one told, and I have always
thought it was Jane, and that is why we did
not ask too many questions about what No&euml;l
had told her, because late that night Father
came and said he now understood that we had
meant to do right, except perhaps the one
who cut the pipe with a chisel, and that must
have been more silliness than naughtiness;
and perhaps the being dyed blue served our
cousin rather right. And he gave Archibald
a few remarks in private, and when the dye
began to come off&mdash;it was not a fast dye,
though it said so on the paper it was wrapped
in&mdash;Archibald, now a light streaky blue, really
did seem to be making an effort to be something
like decent. And when, now merely a
pale grey, he had returned to school, he sent
us a letter. It said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>My dear Cousins</i>,&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>"<i>I think that I was beastlier than I meant to
be, but I am not accustomed to young kids.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
And I think uncle was right, and the way you
stand up for the honour of our house is not
all nonsense, like I said it was. If we ever meet
in the future life I hope you will not keep a
down on me about things. I don't think you
can expect me to say more. From your affectionate
cousin,</i></p>

<div class='sig'>
"<i>Archibald Bastable.</i>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>So I suppose rays of remorse penetrated
that cold heart, and now perhaps he will be a
reformed Bastable. I am sure I hope so, but
I believe it is difficult, if not impossible, for a
leopard to change his skin.</p>

<p>Still, I remember how indelibly black he
looked when he came out of the fatal bath-room;
and it nearly all wore off. And perhaps
spots on the honourable inside parts of
your soul come off with time. I hope so.
The dye never came off the inside of the
bath though. I think that was what annoyed
our good great-uncle the most.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>OVER THE WATER TO CHINA</i></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Oswald</span> is a very modest boy, I believe, but
even he would not deny that he has an active
brain. The author has heard both his Father
and Albert's uncle say so. And the most far-reaching
ideas often come to him quite
naturally&mdash;just as silly notions that aren't
any good might come to you. And he had
an idea which he meant to hold a council;
about with his brothers and sisters; but just
as he was going to unroll his idea to them our
Father occurred suddenly in our midst and
said a strange cousin was coming, and he
came, and he was strange indeed! And when
Fate had woven the threads of his dark
destiny and he had been dyed a dark bright
navy-blue, and had gone from our midst,
Oswald went back to the idea that he had
not forgotten. The words "tenacious of
purpose" mean sticking to things, and these
words always make me think of the character
of the young hero of these pages. At least
I suppose his brothers Dicky and No&euml;l and
H.O. are heroes too, in a way, but somehow
the author of these lines knows more about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Oswald's inside realness than he does about
the others. But I am getting too deep for
words.</div>

<p>So Oswald went into the common-room.
Every one was busy. No&euml;l and H.O. were
playing Halma. Dora was covering boxes
with silver paper to put sweets in for a school
treat, and Dicky was making a cardboard
model of a new screw he has invented for
ocean steamers. But Oswald did not mind
interrupting, because Dora ought not to work
too hard, and Halma always ends in a row,
and I would rather not say what I think of
Dicky's screw. So Oswald said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I want a council. Where's Alice?"</p>

<p>Every one said they didn't know, and they
made haste to say that we couldn't have a
council without her. But Oswald's determined
nature made him tell H.O. to chuck that
rotten game and go and look for her. H.O.
is our youngest brother, and it is right that
he should remember this and do as he was
told. But he happened to be winning the
beastly Halma game, and Oswald saw that there
was going to be trouble&mdash;"big trouble," as
Mr. Kipling says. And he was just bracing his
young nerves for the conflict with H.O., because
he was not going to stand any nonsense from
his young brother about his not fetching Alice
when he was jolly well told to, when the
missing maiden bounced into the room bearing
upon her brow the marks of ravaging agitatedness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have any of you seen Pincher?" she cried,
in haste.</p>

<p>We all said, "No, not since last night."</p>

<p>"Well, then, he's lost," Alice said, making
the ugly face that means you are going to
blub in half a minute.</p>

<p>Every one had sprung to their feet. Even
No&euml;l and H.O. saw at once what a doddering
game Halma is, and Dora and Dicky, whatever
their faults, care more for Pincher than for
boxes and screws. Because Pincher is our fox-terrier.
He is of noble race, and he was ours
when we were poor, lonely treasure-seekers
and lived in humble hard-upness in the
Lewisham Road.</p>

<p>To the faithful heart of young Oswald the
Blackheath affluent mansion and all it contains,
even the stuffed fox eating a duck in the glass
case in the hall that he is so fond of, and even
the council he wanted to have, seemed to
matter much less than old Pincher.</p>

<p>"I want you all to let's go out and look for
him," said Alice, carrying out the meaning of
the faces she had made and beginning to howl.
"Oh, Pincher, suppose something happens to
him; you might get my hat and coat, Dora.
Oh, oh, oh!"</p>

<p>We all got our coats and hats, and by the
time we were ready Alice had conquered it to
only sniffing, or else, as Oswald told her kindly,
she wouldn't have been allowed to come.</p>

<p>"Let's go on the Heath," No&euml;l said. "The
dear departed dog used to like digging there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>So we went. And we said to every single
person we met&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please have you seen a thorough-bred fox-terrier
dog with a black patch over one eye,
and another over his tail, and a tan patch on
his right shoulder?" And every one said, "No,
they hadn't," only some had more polite ways
of saying it than others. But after a bit we
met a policeman, and he said, "I see one when
I was on duty last night, like what you
describe, but it was at the end of a string.
There was a young lad at the other end. The
dog didn't seem to go exactly willing."</p>

<p>He also told us the lad and the dog had
gone over Greenwich way. So we went down,
not quite so wretched in our insides, because
now it seemed that there was some chance,
though we wondered the policeman <i>could</i> have
let Pincher go when he saw he didn't want to,
but he said it wasn't his business. And now
we asked every one if they'd seen a lad and
a thoroughbred fox-terrier with a black patch,
and cetera.</p>

<p>And one or two people said they had, and
we thought it must be the same the policeman
had seen, because they said, too, that the dog
didn't seem to care about going where he was
going.</p>

<p>So we went on and through the Park and
past the Naval College, and we didn't even
stop to look at that life-sized firm ship in the
playground that the Naval Collegians have to
learn about ropes and spars on, and Oswald<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
would willingly give a year of his young life
to have that ship for his very own.</p>

<p>And we didn't go into the Painted Hall
either, because our fond hearts were with
Pincher, and we could not really have enjoyed
looking at Nelson's remains, of the shipwrecks
where the drowning people all look so dry,
or even the pictures where young heroes are
boarding pirates from Spain, just as Oswald
would do if he had half a chance, with the
pirates fighting in attitudes more twisted and
Spanish than the pirates of any nation could
manage even if they were not above it. It is
an odd thing, but all those pictures are awfully
bad weather&mdash;even the ones that are not shipwrecks.
And yet in books the skies are
usually a stainless blue and the sea is a liquid
gem when you are engaged in the avocation
of pirate-boarding.</p>

<p>The author is sorry to see that he is not
going on with the story.</p>

<p>We walked through Greenwich Hospital
and asked there if they have seen Pincher,
because I heard Father say once that dogs
are sometimes stolen and taken to hospitals
and never seen again. It is wrong to steal,
but I suppose the hospital doctors forget this
because they are so sorry for the poor ill
people, and like to give them dogs to play
with them and amuse them on their beds of
anguish. But no one had seen our Pincher,
who seemed to be becoming more dear to our
hearts every moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>When we got through the Hospital grounds&mdash;they
are big and the buildings are big, and I
like it all because there's so much room everywhere
and nothing niggling&mdash;we got down
to the terrace over the river, next to the
Trafalgar Hotel. And there was a sailor
leaning on the railings, and we asked him the
usual question. It seems that he was asleep,
but of course we did not know, or we would
not have disturbed him. He was very angry,
and he swore, and Oswald told the girls to
come away; but Alice pulled away from
Oswald and said,</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be so cross. Do tell us if you've
seen our dog? He is&mdash;&mdash;" and she recited
Pincher's qualifications.</p>

<p>"Ho yes," said the sailor&mdash;he had a red and
angry face. "I see 'im a hour ago 'long of a
Chinaman. 'E crossed the river in a open
boat. You'd best look slippy arter 'im." He
grinned and spat; he was a detestable
character, I think. "Chinamen puts puppy-dogs
in pies. If 'e catches you three young
chaps 'e'll 'ave a pie as'll need a big crust to
cover it. Get along with your cheek!"</p>

<p>So we got along. Of course, we knew that
the Chinese are not cannibals, so we were not
frightened by that rot; but we knew, too,
that the Chinese do really eat dogs, as well as
rats and birds' nests and other disgraceful
forms of eating.</p>


<p>H.O. was very tired, and he said his boots
hurt him; and No&euml;l was beginning to look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
like a young throstle&mdash;all eyes and beak. He
always does when he is tired. The others
were tired too, but their proud spirits would
never have owned it. So we went round to
the Trafalgar Hotel's boathouse, and there
was a man in slippers, and we said could we
have a boat, and he said he would send a
boatman, and would we walk in?</p>

<span class="caption">IT SEEMS THE SAILOR WAS ASLEEP, BUT OF COURSE WE DID NOT KNOW, OR WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DISTURBED HIM.</span>
</div>

<p>We did, and we went through a dark room
piled up to the ceiling with boats and out on
to a sort of thing half like a balcony and half
like a pier. And there were boats there too,
far more than you would think any one could
want; and then a boy came. We said we
wanted to go across the river, and he said,
"Where to?"</p>

<p>"To where the Chinamen live," said Alice.</p>

<p>"You can go to Millwall if you want to," he
said, beginning to put oars into the boat.</p>

<p>"Are there any Chinese people there?" Alice
asked.</p>

<p>And the boy replied, "I dunno." He added
that he supposed we could pay for the boat.</p>

<p>By a fortunate accident&mdash;I think Father
had rather wanted to make up to us for our
martyr-like enduring when our cousin was
with us&mdash;we were fairly flush of chink.
Oswald and Dicky were proudly able to
produce handfuls of money; it was mostly
copper, but it did not fail of its effect.</p>

<p>The boy seemed not to dislike us quite so
much as before, and he helped the girls into
the boat, which was now in the water at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
edge of a sort of floating, unsteady raft, with
openings in it that you could see the water
through. The water was very rough, just
like real sea, and not like a river at all. And
the boy rowed; he wouldn't let us, although I
can, quite well. The boat tumbled and tossed
just like a sea-boat. When we were about
half-way over, No&euml;l pulled Alice's sleeve and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do I look very green?"</p>

<p>"You do rather, dear," she said kindly.</p>

<p>"I feel much greener than I look," said
No&euml;l. And later on he was not at all well.</p>

<p>The boy laughed, but we pretended not to
notice. I wish I could tell you half the things
we saw as our boat was pulled along through
the swishing, lumpy water that turned into
great waves after every steamer that went by.
Oswald was quite fit, but some of the others
were very silent. Dicky says he saw everything
that Oswald saw, but I am not sure.
There were wharves and engines, and great
rusty cranes swinging giant's handfuls of iron
rails about in the air, and once we passed a
ship that was being broken up. All the wood
was gone, and they were taking away her
plates, and the red rust was running from her
and colouring the water all round; it looked
as though she was bleeding to death. I
suppose it was silly to feel sorry for her, but
I did. I thought how beastly it was that she
would never go to sea again, where the waves
are clean and green, even if no rougher than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the black waves now raging around our
staunch little bark. I never knew before
what lots of kinds of ships there can be,
and I think I could have gone on and on for
ever and ever looking at the shapes of things
and the colours they were, and dreaming
about being a pirate, and things like that,
but we had come some way; and now Alice
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oswald, I think No&euml;l will die if we don't
make land soon."</p>

<p>And indeed he had been rather bad for
some time, only I thought it was kinder to
take no notice.</p>

<p>So our ship was steered among other pirate
craft, and moored at a landing-place where
there were steps up.</p>

<p>No&euml;l was now so ill that we felt we could
not take him on a Chinese hunt, and H.O. had
sneaked his boots off in the boat, and he said
they hurt him too much to put them on again;
so it was arranged that those two should sit
on a dry corner of the steps and wait, and
Dora said she would stay with them.</p>

<p>"I think we ought to go home," she said.
"I'm quite sure Father wouldn't like us being
in these wild, savage places. The police ought
to find Pincher."</p>

<p>But the others weren't going to surrender
like that, especially as Dora had actually had
the sense to bring a bag of biscuits, which
all, except No&euml;l, were now eating.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they ought, but they <i>won't</i>," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Dicky. "I'm boiling hot. I'll leave you my
overcoat in case you're cold."</p>

<p>Oswald had been just about to make the
same manly proposal, though he was not
extra warm. So they left their coats, and,
with Alice, who would come though told not
to, they climbed the steps, and went along a
narrow passage and started boldly on the
Chinese hunt. It was a strange sort of place
over the river; all the streets were narrow,
and the houses and the pavements and the
people's clothes and the mud in the road all
seemed the same sort of dull colour&mdash;a sort of
brown-grey it was.</p>

<p>All the house doors were open, and you
could see that the insides of the houses were
the same colour as the outsides. Some of the
women had blue, or violet or red shawls, and
they sat on the doorsteps and combed their
children's hair, and shouted things to each
other across the street. They seemed very
much struck by the appearance of the three
travellers, and some of the things they said
were not pretty.</p>

<p>That was the day when Oswald found out a
thing that has often been of use to him in
after-life. However rudely poor people stare
at you they become all right instantly if you
ask them something. I think they don't hate
you so much when they've done something for
you, if it's only to tell you the time or the
way.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/gs10.png" width="344" height="400" alt="WE WENT ROUND A CORNER RATHER FAST, AND CAME SLAP INTO THE LARGEST WOMAN I HAVE EVER SEEN." title="WE WENT ROUND A CORNER RATHER FAST, AND CAME SLAP INTO THE LARGEST WOMAN I HAVE EVER SEEN." />
<span class="caption">WE WENT ROUND A CORNER RATHER FAST, AND CAME SLAP INTO THE LARGEST WOMAN I HAVE EVER SEEN.</span>
</div>

<p>So we got on very well, but it does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
make me comfortable to see people so poor
and we have such a jolly house. People in
books feel this, and I know it is right to feel
it, but I hate the feeling all the same. And it
is worse when the people are nice to you.</p>

<p>And we asked and asked and asked, but
nobody had seen a dog or a Chinaman, and
I began to think all was indeed lost, and you
can't go on biscuits all day, when we went
round a corner rather fast, and came slap
into the largest woman I have ever seen. She
must have been yards and yards round, and
before she had time to be in the rage that
we saw she was getting into, Alice said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon! I <i>am</i> so sorry, but
we really didn't mean to! I <i>do</i> so hope we
didn't hurt you!"</p>

<p>We saw the growing rage fade away, and
she said, as soon as she got her fat breath&mdash;</p>

<p>"No 'arm done, my little dear. An' w'ere
are you off to in such a 'urry?"</p>

<p>So we told her all about it. She was quite
friendly, although so stout, and she said we
oughtn't to be gallivanting about all on our
own. We told her we were all right, though
I own Oswald was glad that in the hurry of
departing Alice hadn't had time to find anything
smarter-looking to wear than her
garden coat and grey Tam, which had been
regretted by some earlier in the day.</p>

<p>"Well," said the woman, "if you go along
this 'ere turning as far as ever you can go,
and then take the first to the right and bear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
round to the left, and take the second to the
right again, and go down the alley between
the stumps, you'll come to Rose Gardens.
There's often Chinamen about there. And if
you come along this way as you come back,
keep your eye open for me, and I'll arks
some young chaps as I know as is interested
like in dogs, and perhaps I'll have news for
you."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," Alice said, and the
woman asked her to give her a kiss. Everybody
is always wanting to kiss Alice. I can't
think why. And we got her to tell us the
way again, and we noticed the name of the
street, and it was Nightingale Street, and
the stairs where we had left the others was
Bullamy's Causeway, because we have the
true explorer's instincts, and when you can't
blaze your way on trees with your axe, or lay
crossed twigs like the gypsies do, it is best to
remember the names of streets.</p>

<p>So we said goodbye, and went on through
the grey-brown streets with hardly any
shops, and those only very small and common,
and we got to the alley all right. It was a
narrow place between high blank brown-grey
walls. I think by the smell it was gasworks
and tanneries. There was hardly any one
there, but when we got into it we heard feet
running ahead of us, and Oswald said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hullo, suppose that's some one with
Pincher, and they've recognized his long-lost
masters and they're making a bolt for it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>And we all started running as hard as ever
we could. There was a turn in the passage,
and when we got round it we saw that the
running was stopping. There were four or
five boys in a little crowd round some one in
blue&mdash;blue looked such a change after the
muddy colour of everything in that dead
Eastern domain&mdash;and when we got up, the
person the blue was on was a very wrinkled
old man, with a yellow wrinkled face and a
soft felt hat and blue blouse-like coat, and I
see that I ought not to conceal any longer
from the discerning reader that it was exactly
what we had been looking for. It was indeed
a Celestial Chinaman in deep difficulties with
these boys who were, as Alice said afterwards,
truly fiends in mortal shape. They were
laughing at the old Chinaman, and shouting
to each other, and their language was of that
kind that I was sorry we had got Alice with
us. But she told Oswald afterwards that she
was so angry she did not know what they
were saying.</p>

<p>"Pull his bloomin' pigtail," said one of these
outcasts from decent conduct.</p>

<p>The old man was trying to keep them off
with both hands, but the hands were very
wrinkled and trembly.</p>

<p>Oswald is grateful to his good Father who
taught him and Dicky the proper way to put
their hands up. If it had not been for that,
Oswald does not know what on earth would
have happened, for the outcasts were five to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
our two, because no one could have expected
Alice to do what she did.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 458px;">
<img src="images/gs11.png" width="458" height="400" alt="IT WAS INDEED A CELESTIAL CHINAMAN IN DEEP DIFFICULTIES." title="IT WAS INDEED A CELESTIAL CHINAMAN IN DEEP DIFFICULTIES." />
<span class="caption">IT WAS INDEED A CELESTIAL CHINAMAN IN DEEP DIFFICULTIES.</span>
</div>

<p>Before Oswald had even got his hands into
the position required by the noble art of self-defence,
she had slapped the largest boy on
the face as hard as ever she could&mdash;and she
can slap pretty hard, as Oswald knows but
too well&mdash;and she had taken the second-sized
boy and was shaking him before Dicky could
get his left in on the eye of the slapped
assailant of the aged denizen of the Flowery
East. The other three went for Oswald, but
three to one is nothing to one who has hopes
of being a pirate in his spare time when he
grows up.</p>

<p>In an instant the five were on us. Dicky
and I got in some good ones, and though
Oswald cannot approve of my sister being in
a street fight, he must own she was very
quick and useful in pulling ears and twisting
arms and slapping and pinching. But she
had quite forgotten how to hit out from the
shoulder like I have often shown her.</p>

<p>The battle raged, and Alice often turned the
tide of it by a well-timed shove or nip. The
aged Eastern leaned against the wall, panting
and holding his blue heart with his yellow
hand. Oswald had got a boy down, and was
kneeling on him, and Alice was trying to pull
off two other boys who had fallen on top of
the fray, while Dicky was letting the fifth
have it, when there was a flash of blue and
another Chinaman dashed into the tournament.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Fortunately this one was not old, and
with a few well-directed, if foreign looking,
blows he finished the work so ably begun by
the brave Bastables, and next moment the
five loathsome and youthful aggressors were
bolting down the passage. Oswald and Dicky
were trying to get their breath and find out
exactly where they were hurt and how much,
and Alice had burst out crying and was howling
as though she would never stop. That is
the worst of girls&mdash;they never can keep anything
up. Any brave act they may suddenly
do, when for a moment they forget that they
have not the honour to be boys, is almost
instantly made into contemptibility by a
sudden attack of crybabyishness. But I will
say no more: for she did strike the first blow,
after all, and it did turn out that the boys had
scratched her wrist and kicked her shins.
These things make girls cry.</p>

<p>The venerable stranger from distant shores
said a good deal to the other in what I
suppose was the language used in China. It
all sounded like "hung" and "li" and "chi,"
and then the other turned to us and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nicee lilly girlee, same piecee flowelee, you
takee my head to walkee on. This is alle
samee my father first chop ancestor. Dirty
white devils makee him hurt. You come
alongee fightee ploper. Me likee you welly
muchee."</p>

<p>Alice was crying too much to answer,
especially as she could not find her handkerchief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
I gave her mine, and then she was
able to say that she did not want to walk
on anybody's head, and she wanted to go
home.</p>

<p>"This not nicee place for lillee whitee
girlee," said the young Chinaman. His pigtail
was thicker than his father's and black
right up to the top. The old man's was grey
at the beginning, but lower down it was black,
because that part of it was not hair at all, but
black threads and ribbons and odds and ends
of trimmings, and towards the end both pigtails
were greenish.</p>

<p>"Me lun backee takee him safee," the
younger of the Eastern adventurers went on,
pointing to his father. "Then me makee
walkee all alonk you, takee you back same
placee you comee from. Little white devils
waitee for you on ce load. You comee with?
Not? Lillee girlee not cly. John givee her
one piecee pletty-pletty. Come makee talkee
with the House Lady."</p>

<p>I believe this is about what he said, and we
understood that he wanted us to come and
see his mother, and that he would give Alice
something pretty, and then see us safe out of
the horrible brown-grey country.</p>

<p>So we agreed to go with them, for we knew
those five boys would be waiting for us on the
way back, most likely with strong reinforcements.
Alice stopped crying the minute she
could&mdash;I must say she is better than Dora in
that way&mdash;and we followed the Chinamen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
who walked in single file like Indians, so
we did the same, and talked to each other
over our shoulders. Our grateful Oriental
friends led us through a good many streets,
and suddenly opened a door with a key,
pulled us in, and shut the door. Dick thought
of the kidnapping of Florence Dombey and
good Mrs. Brown, but Oswald had no such
unnoble thoughts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;">
<img src="images/gs12.png" width="540" height="400" alt="ON THE SIDEBOARD WAS A BLUEY-WHITE CROCKERY IMAGE." title="ON THE SIDEBOARD WAS A BLUEY-WHITE CROCKERY IMAGE." />
<span class="caption">ON THE SIDEBOARD WAS A BLUEY-WHITE CROCKERY IMAGE.</span>
</div>

<p>The room was small, and very, very odd.
It was very dirty too, but perhaps it is not
polite to say that. There was a sort of sideboard
at one end of the room, with an
embroidered dirty cloth on it, and on the
cloth a bluey-white crockery image over a
foot high. It was very fat and army and
leggy, and I think it was an idol. The
minute we got inside the young man
lighted little brown sticks, and set them
to burn in front of it. I suppose it was
incense. There was a sort of long, wide,
low sofa, without any arms or legs, and a
table that was like a box, with another box
in front of it for you to sit down on when
you worked, and on the table were all sorts
of tiny little tools&mdash;awls and brads they
looked like&mdash;and pipe-stems and broken
bowls of pipes and mouthpieces, for our
rescued Chinaman was a pipe-mender by
trade. There wasn't much else in the room
except the smell, and that seemed to fill it
choke-full. The smell seemed to have all
sorts of things in it&mdash;glue and gunpowder,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and white garden lilies and burnt fat, and it
was not so easy to breathe as plain air.</p>

<p>Then a Chinese lady came in. She had
green-grey trousers, shiny like varnish, and
a blue gown, and her hair was pulled back
very tight, and twisted into a little knob at
the back.</p>

<p>She wanted to go down on the floor before
Alice, but we wouldn't let her. Then she said
a great many things that we feel sure were
very nice, only they were in Chinese, so we
could not tell what they were.</p>

<p>And the Chinaman said that his mother
also wanted Alice to walk on her head&mdash;not
Alice's own, of course, but the mother's.</p>

<p>I wished we had stayed longer, and tried
harder to understand what they said, because
it was an adventure, take it how you
like, that we're not likely to look upon the
like of again. Only we were too flustered
to see this.</p>

<p>We said, "Don't mention it," and things
like that; and when Dicky said, "I think we
ought to be going," Oswald said so too.</p>

<p>Then they all began talking Chinese like
mad, and the Chinese lady came back and
suddenly gave Alice a parrot.</p>

<p>It was red and green, with a very long tail,
and as tame as any pet fawn I ever read
about. It walked up her arm and round
her neck, and stroked her face with its
beak. And it did not bite Oswald or Alice,
or even Dicky, though they could not be sure
at first that it was not going to.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>We said all the polite things we could, and
the old lady made thousands of hurried
Chinese replies, and repeated many times,
"All litey, John," which seemed to be all
the English she knew.</p>

<p>We never had so much fuss made over us
in all our lives. I think it was that that
upset our calmness, and seemed to put us
into a sort of silly dream that made us not
see what idiots we were to hurry off from
scenes we should never again behold. So we
went. And the youthful Celestial saw us
safely to the top of Bullamy's Stairs, and
left us there with the parrot and floods of
words that seemed all to end in double "e."</p>

<p>We wanted to show him to the others, but
he would not come, so we rejoined our
anxious relations without him.</p>

<p>The scene of rejoinder was painful, at first
because they were most frightfully sick at us
having been such an age away; but when we
let them look at the parrot, and told them
about the fight, they agreed that it was not
our fault, and we really had been unavoidably
detained.</p>

<p>But Dora said, "Well, you may say I'm
always preaching, but I <i>don't</i> think Father
would like Alice to be fighting street boys
in Millwall."</p>

<p>"I suppose <i>you'd</i> have run away and let the
old man be killed," said Dicky, and peace was
not restored till we were nearly at Greenwich
again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>We took the tram to Greenwich Station,
and then we took a cab home (and well worth
the money, which was all we now had got,
except fourpence-halfpenny), for we were all
dog-tired.</p>

<p>And dog-tired reminds me that we hadn't
found Pincher, in spite of all our trouble.</p>

<p>Miss Blake, who is our housekeeper, was
angrier than I have ever seen her. She had
been so anxious that she had sent the police
to look for us. But, of course, they had not
found us. You ought to make allowances for
what people do when they are anxious, so I
forgive her everything, even what she said
about Oswald being a disgrace to a respectable
house. He owns we were rather muddy,
owing to the fight.</p>

<p>And when the jaw was over and we were
having tea&mdash;and there was meat to it, because
we were as near starving as I ever wish to
be&mdash;we all ate lots. Even the thought of
Pincher could not thwart our bold appetites,
though we kept saying, "Poor old Pincher!"
"I do wish we'd found him," and things like
that. The parrot walked about among the
tea-things as tame as tame. And just as
Alice was saying how we'd go out again
to-morrow and have another try for our
faithful hound there was a scratching at the
door, and we rushed&mdash;and there was Pincher,
perfectly well and mad with joy to see us.</p>

<p>H.O. turned an abrupt beetroot colour.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>We said, "What? Out with it."</p>

<p>And though he would much rather have
kept it a secret buried in his breast, we made
him own that he had shut Pincher up yesterday
in the empty rabbit-hutch when he was
playing Zoological Gardens and forgotten all
about it in the pleasures of our cousin having
left us.</p>

<p>So we need not have gone over the water
at all. But though Oswald pities all dumb
animals, especially those helplessly shut in
rabbit-hutches at the bottoms of gardens, he
cannot be sorry that we had such a Celestial
adventure and got hold of such a parrot.
For Alice says that Oswald and Dicky and
she shall have the parrot between them.</p>

<p>She is tremendously straight. I often
wonder why she was made a girl. She's a
jolly sight more of a gentleman than half
the boys at our school.</p>

<h2><i>THE YOUNG ANTIQUARIES</i></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">This</span> really happened before Christmas, but
many authors go back to bygone years for
whole chapters, and I don't see why I
shouldn't.</div>

<p>It was one Sunday&mdash;the Somethingth
Sunday in Advent, I think&mdash;and Denny and
Daisy and their father and Albert's uncle
came to dinner, which is in the middle of the
day on that day of rest and the same things
to eat for grown-ups and us. It is nearly
always roast beef and Yorkshire, but the
puddings and vegetables are brightly variegated
and never the same two Sundays running.</p>

<p>At dinner some one said something about
the coat-of-arms that is on the silver tankards
which once, when we were poor and honest,
used to stay at the shop having the dents
slowly taken out of them for months and
months. But now they are always at home
and are put at the four corners of the table
every day, and any grown-up who likes can
drink beer out of them.</p>

<p>After some talk of the sort you don't listen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to, in which bends and lioncels and gules and
things played a promising part, Albert's uncle
said that Mr. Turnbull had told him something
about that coat-of-arms being carved
on a bridge somewhere in Cambridgeshire,
and again the conversation wandered into
things like Albert's uncle had talked about
to the Maidstone Antiquarian Society the
day they came over to see his old house in
the country and we arranged the time-honoured
Roman remains for them to dig
up. So, hearing the words king-post and
mullion and moulding and underpin, Oswald
said might we go; and we went, and took
our dessert with us and had it in our own
common-room, where you can roast chestnuts
with a free heart and never mind what your
fingers get like.</p>

<p>When first we knew Daisy we used to call
her the White Mouse, and her brother had
all the appearance of being one too, but you
know how untruthful appearances are, or else
it was that we taught him happier things, for
he certainly turned out quite different in the
end; and she was not a bad sort of kid,
though we never could quite cure her of
wanting to be "ladylike"&mdash;that is the beastliest
word there is, I think, and Albert's uncle
says so, too. He says if a girl can't be a lady
it's not worth while to be only like one&mdash;she'd
better let it alone and be a free and happy
bounder.</p>

<p>But all this is not what I was going to say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
only the author does think of so many things
besides the story, and sometimes he puts
them in. This is the case with Thackeray
and the Religious Tract Society and other
authors, as well as Mrs. Humphrey Ward.
Only I don't suppose you have ever heard of
her, though she writes books that some
people like very much. But perhaps they
are her friends. I did not like the one I
read about the Baronet. It was on a wet
Sunday at the seaside, and nothing else in
the house but Bradshaw and "Elsie; or like
a&mdash;&mdash;" or I shouldn't have. But what really
happened to us before Christmas is strictly
the following narrative.</p>

<p>"I say," remarked Denny, when he had
burned his fingers with a chestnut that
turned out a bad one after all&mdash;and such is
life&mdash;and he had finished sucking his fingers
and getting rid of the chestnut, "about these
antiquaries?"</p>

<p>"Well, what about them?" said Oswald.
He always tries to be gentle and kind to
Denny, because he knows he helped to make
a man of the young Mouse.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think," said Denny, "that it
was so very difficult to be one."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Dicky. "You have to
read very dull books and an awful lot of them,
and remember what you read, what's more."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Alice. "That girl
who came with the antiquities&mdash;the one
Albert's uncle said was upholstered in red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
plush like furniture&mdash;<i>she</i> hadn't read anything,
you bet."</p>

<p>Dora said, "You ought not to bet, especially
on Sunday," and Alice altered it to "You may
be sure."</p>

<p>"Well, but what then?" Oswald asked
Denny. "Out with it," for he saw that his
youthful friend had got an idea and couldn't
get it out. You should always listen patiently
to the ideas of others, no matter how silly
you expect them to be.</p>

<p>"I do wish you wouldn't hurry me so," said
Denny, snapping his fingers anxiously. And
we tried to be patient.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't we <i>be</i> them?" Denny said
at last.</p>

<p>"He means antiquaries," said Oswald to the
bewildered others. "But there's nowhere to
go and nothing to do when we get there."</p>

<p>The Dentist (so-called for short, his real
name being Denis) got red and white, and
drew Oswald aside to the window for a secret
discussion. Oswald listened as carefully as he
could, but Denny always buzzes so when he
whispers.</p>

<p>"Right oh," he remarked, when the confidings
of the Dentist had got so that you
could understand what he was driving at.
"Though you're being shy with us now, after
all we went through together in the summer,
is simply skittles."</p>

<p>Then he turned to the polite and attentive
others and said&mdash;</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"You remember that day we went to
Bexley Heath with Albert's uncle? Well,
there was a house, and Albert's uncle said a
clever writer lived there, and in more ancient
years that chap in history&mdash;Sir Thomas What's
his name; and Denny thinks he might let us
be antiquaries there. It looks a ripping place
from the railway."</p>

<p>It really does. It's a fine big house, and
splendid gardens, and a lawn with a sundial,
and the tallest trees anywhere about here.</p>

<p>"But what could we <i>do?</i>" said Dicky. "I
don't suppose <i>he'd</i> give <i>us</i> tea," though such,
indeed, had been our hospitable conduct to
the antiquaries who came to see Albert's
uncle.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Alice. "We might
dress up for it, and wear spectacles, and we
could all read papers. It would be lovely&mdash;something
to fill up the Christmas holidays&mdash;the
part before the wedding, I mean. Do
let's."</p>

<p>"All right, I don't mind. I suppose it would
be improving," said Dora. "We should have
to read a lot of history. You can settle it.
I'm going to show Daisy our bridesmaids'
dresses."</p>

<p>It was, alas! too true. Albert's uncle was
to be married but shortly after, and it was
partly our faults, though that does not come
into this story.</p>

<p>So the two D.'s went to look at the clothes&mdash;girls
like this&mdash;but Alice, who wishes she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
had never consented to be born a girl, stayed
with us, and we had a long and earnest
council about it.</p>

<p>"One thing," said Oswald, "it can't possibly
be wrong&mdash;so perhaps it won't be amusing."</p>

<p>"Oh, Oswald!" said Alice, and she spoke
rather like Dora.</p>

<p>"I don't mean what you mean," said Oswald
in lofty scorn. "What I mean to say is that
when a thing is quite sure to be right, it's not
so&mdash;well&mdash;I mean to say there it is, don't you
know; and if it might be wrong, and isn't, it's
a score to you; and if it might be wrong, and
is&mdash;as so often happens&mdash;well, you know yourself,
adventures sometimes turn out wrong
that you didn't think were going to, but
seldom, or never, the uninteresting kind,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dicky told Oswald to dry up&mdash;which, of
course, no one stands from a younger
brother, but though Oswald explained this
at the time, he felt in his heart that he
has sometimes said what he meant with
more clearness. When Oswald and Dicky
had finished, we went on and arranged
everything.</p>

<p>Every one was to write a paper&mdash;and
read it.</p>

<p>"If the papers are too long to read while
we're there," said No&euml;l, "we can read them in
the long winter evenings when we are grouped
along the household hearthrug. I shall do
my paper in poetry&mdash;about Agincourt."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of us thought Agincourt wasn't fair,
because no one could be sure about any knight
who took part in that well-known conflict
having lived in the Red House; but Alice got
us to agree, because she said it would be
precious dull if we all wrote about nothing
but Sir Thomas Whatdoyoucallhim&mdash;whose
real name in history Oswald said he would
find out, and then write his paper on that
world-renowned person, who is a household
word in all families. Denny said he would
write about Charles the First, because they
were just doing that part at his school.</p>

<p>"I shall write about what happened in
1066," said H.O. "I know that."</p>

<p>Alice said, "If I write a paper it will be
about Mary Queen of Scots."</p>

<p>Dora and Daisy came in just as she said
this, and it transpired that this ill-fated but
good-looking lady was the only one they
either of them wanted to write about. So
Alice gave it up to them and settled to do
Magna Charta, and they could settle something
between themselves for the one who
would have to give up Mary Queen of Scots
in the end. We all agreed that the story of
that lamented wearer of pearls and black
velvet would not make enough for two
papers.</p>

<p>Everything was beautifully arranged, when
suddenly H.O. said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Supposing he doesn't let us?"</p>

<p>"Who doesn't let us what?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Red House man&mdash;read papers at his
Red House."</p>

<p>This was, indeed, what nobody had thought
of&mdash;and even now we did not think any one
could be so lost to proper hospitableness as to
say no. Yet none of us liked to write and
ask. So we tossed up for it, only Dora had
feelings about tossing up on Sunday, so we
did it with a hymn-book instead of a penny.</p>

<p>We all won except No&euml;l, who lost, so he
said he would do it on Albert's uncle's typewriter,
which was on a visit to us at the time,
waiting for Mr. Remington to fetch it away to
mend the "M." We think it was broken
through Albert's uncle writing "Margaret"
so often, because it is the name of the lady
he was doomed to be married by.</p>

<p>The girls had got the letter the Maidstone
Antiquarian Society and Field Clubs Secretary
had sent to Albert's uncle&mdash;H.O. said they
kept it for a momentum of the day&mdash;and we
altered the dates and names in blue chalk and
put in a piece about might we skate on the
moat, and gave it to No&euml;l, who had already
begun to make up his poetry about Agincourt,
and so had to be shaken before he would
attend. And that evening, when Father and
our Indian uncle and Albert's uncle were
seeing the others on the way to Forest Hill,
No&euml;l's poetry and pencil were taken away
from him and he was shut up in Father's room
with the Remington typewriter, which we
had never been forbidden to touch. And I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
don't think he hurt it much, except quite at
the beginning, when he jammed the "S" and
the "J" and the thing that means per cent. so
that they stuck&mdash;and Dicky soon put that
right with a screwdriver.</p>

<p>He did not get on very well, but kept on
writing MOR7E HOAS5 or MORD6M HOVCE
on new pieces of paper and then beginning
again, till the floor was strewn with his
remains; so we left him at it, and went and
played Celebrated Painters&mdash;a game even
Dora cannot say anything about on Sunday,
considering the Bible kind of pictures most of
them painted. And much later, the library
door having banged once and the front door
twice, No&euml;l came in and said he had posted it,
and already he was deep in poetry again,
and had to be roused when requisite for
bed.</p>

<p>It was not till next day that he owned that
the typewriter had been a fiend in disguise,
and that the letter had come out so odd that
he could hardly read it himself.</p>

<p>"The hateful engine of destruction wouldn't
answer to the bit in the least," he said, "and
I'd used nearly a wastepaper basket of Father's
best paper, and I thought he might come in
and say something, so I just finished it as well
as I could, and I corrected it with the blue
chalk&mdash;because you'd bagged that B.B. of
mine&mdash;and I didn't notice what name I'd
signed till after I'd licked the stamp."</p>

<p>The hearts of his kind brothers and sisters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
sank low. But they kept them up as well as
they could, and said&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/gs14.png" width="530" height="400" alt="IT WAS NOT TILL NEXT DAY THAT HE OWNED THAT THE TYPEWRITER HAD BEEN A FIEND IN DISGUISE." title="IT WAS NOT TILL NEXT DAY THAT HE OWNED THAT THE TYPEWRITER HAD BEEN A FIEND IN DISGUISE." />
<span class="caption">IT WAS NOT TILL NEXT DAY THAT HE OWNED THAT THE TYPEWRITER HAD BEEN A FIEND IN DISGUISE.</span>
</div>

<p>"What name <i>did</i> you sign?"</p>

<p>And No&euml;l said, "Why, Edward Turnbull,
of course&mdash;like at the end of the real letter.
You never crossed it out like you did his
address."</p>

<p>"No," said Oswald witheringly. "You see,
I did think, whatever else you didn't know,
I did think you knew your own silly name."</p>

<p>Then Alice said Oswald was unkind, though
you see he was not, and she kissed No&euml;l and
said she and he would take turns to watch
for the postman, so as to get the answer
(which of course would be subscribed on the
envelope with the name of Turnbull instead
of Bastable) before the servant could tell
the postman that the name was a stranger
to her.</p>

<p>And next evening it came, and it was very
polite and grown-up&mdash;and said we should be
welcome, and that we might read our papers
and skate on the moat. The Red House has
a moat, like the Moat House in the country,
but not so wild and dangerous. Only we
never skated on it because the frost gave out
the minute we had got leave to. Such is life,
as the sparks fly upwards. (The last above is
called a moral reflection.)</p>

<p>So now, having got leave from Mr. Red House
(I won't give his name because he is a writer
of worldly fame and he might not like it), we
set about writing our papers. It was not bad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
fun, only rather difficult because Dora said
she never knew which Encyclo. volume she
might be wanting, as she was using Edinburgh,
Mary, Scotland, Bothwell, Holywell, and
France, and many others, and Oswald never
knew which he might want, owing to his not
being able exactly to remember the distinguished
and deathless other appellation of
Sir Thomas Thingummy, who had lived in
the Red House.</p>

<p>No&euml;l was up to the ears in Agincourt, yet
that made but little difference to our destiny.
He is always plunged in poetry of one sort or
another, and if it hadn't been that, it would
have been something else. This, at least, we
insisted on having kept a secret, so he could
not read it to us.</p>

<p>H.O. got very inky the first half-holiday,
and then he got some sealing-wax and a big
envelope from Father, and put something in
and fastened it up, and said he had done his.</p>

<p>Dicky would not tell us what his paper was
going to be about, but he said it would not
be like ours, and he let H.O. help him by
looking on while he invented more patent
screws for ships.</p>

<p>The spectacles were difficult. We got three
pairs of the uncle's, and one that had belonged
to the housekeeper's grandfather, but nine
pairs were needed, because Albert-next-door
mouched in one half-holiday and wanted to
join, and said if we'd let him he'd write a
paper on the Constitutions of Clarendon, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
we thought he couldn't do it, so we let him.
And then, after all, he did.</p>

<p>So at last Alice went down to Bennett's in
the village, that we are such good customers
of, because when our watches stop we take
them there, and he lent us a lot of empty
frames on the instinctive understanding that
we would pay for them if we broke them or
let them get rusty.</p>

<p>And so all was ready. And the fatal day
approached; and it was the holidays. For
us, that is, but not for Father, for his business
never seems to rest by day and night, except
at Christmas and times like that. So we did
not need to ask him if we might go. Oswald
thought it would be more amusing for Father
if we told it all to him in the form of an
entertaining anecdote, afterwards.</p>

<p>Denny and Daisy and Albert came to spend
the day.</p>

<p>We told Mrs. Blake Mr. Red House had
asked us, and she let the girls put on their
second-best things, which are coats with capes
and red Tam-o'shanters. These capacious
coats are very good for playing highwaymen
in.</p>

<p>We made ourselves quite clean and tidy.
At the very last we found that H.O. had
been making marks on his face with burnt
matches, to imitate wrinkles, but really it
only imitated dirt, so we made him wash it
off. Then he wanted to paint himself red
like a clown, but we had decided that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
spectacles were to be our only disguise, and
even those were not to be assumed till Oswald
gave the word.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 434px;">

<span class="caption">THE STATIONMASTER AND PORTER LOOKED RESPECTFULLY AT US.</span>
</div>

<p>No casuist observer could have thought
that the nine apparently light-headed and
careless party who now wended their way to
Blackheath Station, looking as if they were
not up to anything in particular, were really
an Antiquarian Society of the deepest dye.
We got an empty carriage to ourselves, and
halfway between Blackheath and the other
station Oswald gave the word, and we all put
on the spectacles. We had our antiquarian
papers of lore and researched history in
exercise-books, rolled up and tied with
string.</p>

<p>The stationmaster and porter, of each of
which the station boasted but one specimen,
looked respectfully at us as we got out of the
train, and we went straight out of the station,
under the railway arch, and down to the
green gate of the Red House. It has a lodge,
but there is no one in it. We peeped in at
the window, and there was nothing in the
room but an old beehive and a broken leather
strap.</p>

<p>We waited in the front for a bit, so that
Mr. Red House could come out and welcome
us like Albert's uncle did the other antiquaries,
but no one came, so we went round
the garden. It was very brown and wet, but
full of things you didn't see every day. Furze
summer-houses, for instance, and a red wall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
all round it, with holes in it that you might
have walled heretics up in in the olden times.
Some of the holes were quite big enough to
have taken a very small heretic. There was
a broken swing, and a fish-pond&mdash;but we were
on business, and Oswald insisted on reading
the papers.</p>

<p>He said, "Let's go to the sundial. It looks
dryer there, my feet are like ice-houses."</p>

<p>It was dryer because there was a soaking
wet green lawn round it, and round that a
sloping path made of little squares of red and
white marble. This was quite waterless, and
the sun shone on it, so that it was warm to
the hands, though not to the feet, because of
boots. Oswald called on Albert to read first.
Albert is not a clever boy. He is not one of
us, and Oswald wanted to get over the Constitutions.
For Albert is hardly ever amusing,
even in fun, and when he tries to show off it
is sometimes hard to bear. He read&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>"<span class="smcap">The Constitutions of Clarendon.</span></div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Clarendon (sometimes called Clarence) had
only one constitution. It must have been a
very bad one, because he was killed by a butt
of Malmsey. If he had had more constitutions
or better ones he would have lived to be
very old. This is a warning to everybody."</p></div>

<p>To this day none of us know how he could,
and whether his uncle helped him.</p>

<p>We clapped, of course, but not with our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
hearts, which were hissing inside us, and then
Oswald began to read his paper. He had not
had a chance to ask Albert's uncle what the
other name of the world-famous Sir Thomas
was, so he had to put him in as Sir Thomas
Blank, and make it up by being very strong
on scenes that could be better imagined than
described, and, as we knew that the garden
was five hundred years old, of course he could
bring in any eventful things since the year
1400.</p>

<p>He was just reading the part about the
sundial, which he had noticed from the train
when we went to Bexley Heath. It was
rather a nice piece, I think.</p>

<p>"Most likely this sundial told the time
when Charles the First was beheaded, and
recorded the death-devouring progress of the
Great Plague and the Fire of London. There
is no doubt that the sun often shone even in
these devastating occasions, so that we may
picture Sir Thomas Blank telling the time
here and remarking&mdash;O crikey!"</p>

<p>These last words are what Oswald himself
remarked. Of course a person in history
would never have said them.</p>

<p>The reader of the paper had suddenly heard
a fierce, woodeny sound, like giant singlesticks,
terrifyingly close behind him, and
looking hastily round, he saw a most angry
lady, in a bright blue dress with fur on it, like
a picture, and very large wooden shoes, which
had made the singlestick noise. Her eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
were very fierce, and her mouth tight shut.
She did not look hideous, but more like an
avenging sprite or angel, though of course we
knew she was only mortal, so we took off our
caps. A gentleman also bounded towards us
over some vegetables, and acted as reserve
support to the lady.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;">
<img src="images/gs16.png" width="470" height="400" alt="HER VOICE WHEN SHE TOLD US WE WERE TRESPASSING WAS NOT SO FURIOUS." title="HER VOICE WHEN SHE TOLD US WE WERE TRESPASSING WAS NOT SO FURIOUS." />
<span class="caption">HER VOICE WHEN SHE TOLD US WE WERE TRESPASSING WAS NOT SO FURIOUS.</span>
</div>

<p>Her voice when she told us we were trespassing
and it was a private garden was not
so furious as Oswald had expected from her
face, but it <i>was</i> angry. H.O. at once said it
wasn't her garden, was it? But, of course,
we could see it <i>was</i>, because of her not having
any hat or jacket or gloves, and wearing
those wooden shoes to keep her feet dry,
which no one would do in the street.</p>

<p>So then Oswald said we had leave, and
showed her Mr. Red House's letter.</p>

<p>"But that was written to Mr. Turnbull,"
said she, "and how did <i>you</i> get it?"</p>

<p>Then Mr. Red House wearily begged us to
explain, so Oswald did, in that clear, straightforward
way some people think he has, and
that no one can suspect for an instant. And
he ended by saying how far from comfortable
it would be to have Mr. Turnbull coming with
his thin mouth and his tight legs, and that
we were Bastables, and much nicer than the
tight-legged one, whatever she might think.</p>

<p>And she listened, and then she quite suddenly
gave a most jolly grin and asked us to go on
reading our papers.</p>

<p>It was plain that all disagreeableness was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
at an end, and, to show this even to the
stupidest, she instantly asked us to lunch.
Before we could politely accept H.O. shoved
his oar in as usual and said <i>he</i> would stop
no matter how little there was for lunch
because he liked her very much.</p>

<p>So she laughed, and Mr. Red House laughed,
and she said they wouldn't interfere with the
papers, and they went away and left us.</p>

<p>Of course Oswald and Dicky insisted on
going on with the papers; though the girls
wanted to talk about Mrs. Red House, and
how nice she was, and the way her dress was
made. Oswald finished his paper, but later
he was sorry he had been in such a hurry,
because after a bit Mrs. Red House came
out, and said she wanted to play too. She
pretended to be a very ancient antiquary, and
was most jolly, so that the others read their
papers to her, and Oswald knows she would
have liked his paper best, because it <i>was</i> the
best, though I say it.</p>

<p>Dicky's turned out to be all about that
patent screw, and how Nelson would not
have been killed if his ship had been built
with one.</p>

<p>Daisy's paper was about Lady Jane Grey,
and hers and Dora's were exactly alike, the
dullest by far, because they had got theirs out
of books.</p>

<p>Alice had not written hers because she had
been helping No&euml;l to copy his.</p>

<p>Denny's was about King Charles, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
was very grown-up and fervent about this
ill-fated monarch and white roses.</p>

<p>Mrs. Red House took us into the summer-houses,
where it was warmer, and such is the
wonderful architecture of the Red House
gardens that there was a fresh summer-house
for each paper, except No&euml;l's and H.O.'s, which
were read in the stable. There were no horses
there.</p>

<p>No&euml;l's was very long, and it began&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"This is the story of Agincourt.<br />

<p>And so on and so on, till some of us
wondered why poetry was ever invented.
But Mrs. Red House said she liked it awfully,
so No&euml;l said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You may have it to keep. I've got
another one of it at home."</p>

<p>"I'll put it next my heart, No&euml;l," she said.
And she did, under the blue stuff and fur.</p>

<p>H.O.'s was last, but when we let him read it
he wouldn't, so Dora opened his envelope and
it was thick inside with blotting-paper, and
in the middle there was a page with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
"<span class="smcap">1066 William the Conqueror</span>,"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and nothing else.</div>

<p>"Well," he said, "I said I'd write all I knew
about 1066, and that's it. I can't write more
than I know, can I?" The girls said he
couldn't, but Oswald thought he might
have tried.</p>

<p>"It wasn't worth blacking your face all
over just for that," he said. But Mrs. Red
House laughed very much and said it was
a lovely paper, and told <i>her</i> all she wanted
to know about 1066.</p>

<p>Then we went into the garden again and
ran races, and Mrs. Red House held all our
spectacles for us and cheered us on. She
said she was the Patent Automatic Cheering
Winning-post. We do like her.</p>

<p>Lunch was the glorious end of the Morden
House Antiquarian Society and Field Club's
Field Day. But after lunch was the beginning
of a real adventure such as real antiquarians
hardly ever get. This will be unrolled later.
I will finish with some French out of a
newspaper. Albert's uncle told it me, so I
know it is right. Any of your own grown-ups
will tell you what it means.</p>

<p>PS.&mdash;In case your grown-ups can't be
bothered, "<i>&eacute;motions</i>" mean sensation, I
believe.</p>

<h2><i>THE INTREPID EXPLORER AND<br />
HIS LIEUTENANT</i></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">We</span> had spectacles to play antiquaries in,
and the rims were vaselined to prevent rust,
and it came off on our faces with other kinds
of dirt, and when the antiquary game was
over, Mrs. Red House helped us to wash it off
with all the thoroughness of aunts, and far
more gentleness.</div>

<p>Then, clean and with our hairs brushed, we
were led from the bath-room to the banqueting
hall or dining-room.</p>

<p>It is a very beautiful house. The girls
thought it was bare, but Oswald likes bareness
because it leaves more room for games.
All the furniture was of agreeable shapes
and colours, and so were all the things on
the table&mdash;glasses and dishes and everything.
Oswald politely said how nice everything was.</p>

<p>The lunch was a blissful dream of perfect
A.1.-ness. Tongue, and nuts, and apples, and
oranges, and candied fruits, and ginger-wine
in tiny glasses that No&euml;l said were fairy
goblets. Everybody drank everybody else's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
health&mdash;and No&euml;l told Mrs. Red House just
how lovely she was, and he would have paper
and pencil and write her a poem for her very
own. I will not put it in here, because Mr.
Red House is an author himself, and he might
want to use it in some of his books. And the
writer of these pages has been taught to think
of others, and besides I expect you are jolly
well sick of No&euml;l's poetry.</p>

<span class="caption">THE LUNCH WAS A BLISSFUL DREAM OF A.1.-NESS.</span>
</div>

<p>There was no restrainingness about that
lunch. As far as a married lady can possibly
be a regular brick, Mrs. Red House is one.
And Mr. Red House is not half bad, and
knows how to talk about interesting things
like sieges, and cricket, and foreign postage
stamps.</p>

<p>Even poets think of things sometimes, and
it was No&euml;l who said directly he had finished
his poetry,</p>

<p>"Have you got a secret staircase? And
have you explored your house properly?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;we have," said that well-behaved
and unusual lady&mdash;Mrs. Red House, "but
<i>you</i> haven't. You may if you like. Go
anywhere," she added with the unexpected
magnificence of a really noble heart. "Look
at everything&mdash;only don't make hay. Off
with you!" or words to that effect.</p>

<p>And the whole of us, with proper thanks,
offed with us instantly, in case she should
change her mind.</p>

<p>I will not describe the Red House to you&mdash;because
perhaps you do not care about a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
house having three staircases and more cupboards
and odd corners than we'd ever seen
before, and great attics with beams, and
enormous drawers on rollers, let into the
wall&mdash;and half the rooms not furnished,
and those that were all with old-looking,
interesting furniture. There was something
about that furniture that even the present
author can't describe&mdash;as though any of it
might have secret drawers or panels&mdash;even
the chairs. It was all beautiful, and mysterious
in the deepest degree.</p>

<p>When we had been all over the house
several times, we thought about the cellars.
There was only one servant in the kitchen (so
we saw Mr. and Mrs. Red House must be poor
but honest, like we used to be), and we said to
her&mdash;</p>

<p>"How do you do? We've got leave to
go wherever we like, and please where are
the cellars, and may we go in?"</p>

<p>She was quite nice, though she seemed to
think there was an awful lot of us. People
often think this. She said:</p>

<p>"Lor, love a duck&mdash;yes, I suppose so," in not
ungentle tones, and showed us.</p>

<p>I don't think we should ever have found
the way from the house into the cellar by
ourselves. There was a wide shelf in the
scullery with a row of gentlemanly boots on
it that had been cleaned, and on the floor
in front a piece of wood. The general servant&mdash;for
such indeed she proved to be&mdash;lifted up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the wood and opened a little door under the
shelf. And there was the beginning of steps,
and the entrance to them was half trap-door,
and half the upright kind&mdash;a thing none of
us had seen before.</p>

<p>She gave us a candle-end, and we pressed
forward to the dark unknown. The stair was
of stone, arched overhead like churches&mdash;and
it twisted most unlike other cellar stairs.
And when we got down it was all arched
like vaults, very cobwebby.</p>

<p>"Just the place for crimes," said Dicky.
There was a beer cellar, and a wine cellar
with bins, and a keeping cellar with hooks
in the ceiling and stone shelves&mdash;just right
for venison pasties and haunches of the same
swift animal.</p>

<p>Then we opened a door and there was a
cellar with a well in it.</p>

<p>"To throw bodies down, no doubt," Oswald
explained.</p>

<p>They were cellars full of glory, and passages
leading from one to the other like the Inquisition,
and I wish ours at home were like them.</p>

<p>There was a pile of beer barrels in the
largest cellar, and it was H.O. who said,
"Why not play 'King of the Castle?'"</p>

<p>So we did. We had a most refreshing
game. It was exactly like Denny to be the
one who slipped down behind the barrels,
and did not break a single one of all his legs
or arms.</p>

<p>"No," he cried, in answer to our anxious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
inquiries. "I'm not hurt a bit, but the wall
here feels soft&mdash;at least not soft&mdash;but it
doesn't scratch your nails like stone does,
so perhaps it's the door of a secret dungeon
or something like that."</p>

<p>"Good old Dentist!" replied Oswald, who
always likes Denny to have ideas of his own,
because it was us who taught him the folly of
white-mousishness.</p>

<p>"It might be," he went on, "but these barrels
are as heavy as lead, and much more awkward
to collar hold of."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we get in some other way?" Alice
said. "There ought to be a subterranean
passage. I expect there is if we only knew."</p>

<p>Oswald has an enormous geographical
bump in his head. He said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here! That far cellar, where the
wall doesn't go quite up to the roof&mdash;that
space we made out was under the dining-room&mdash;I
could creep under there. I believe
it leads into behind this door."</p>

<p>"Get me out! Oh do, do get me out, and
let me come!" shouted the barrel-imprisoned
Dentist from the unseen regions near the
door.</p>

<p>So we got him out by Oswald lying flat on
his front on the top barrel, and the Dentist
clawed himself up by Oswald's hands while
the others kept hold of the boots of the representative
of the house of Bastable, which,
of course, Oswald is, whenever Father is not
there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on," cried Oswald, when Denny
was at last able to appear, very cobwebby
and black. "Give us what's left of the
matches!"</p>

<p>The others agreed to stand by the barrels
and answer our knocking on the door if we
ever got there.</p>

<p>"But I daresay we shall perish on the way,"
said Oswald hopefully.</p>

<p>So we started. The other cellar was easily
found by the ingenious and geography-bump-headed
Oswald. It opened straight on to the
moat, and we think it was a boathouse in
middle-aged times.</p>

<p>Denny made a back for Oswald, who led
the way, and then he turned round and
hauled up his inexperienced, but rapidly
improving, follower on to the top of the wall
that did not go quite up to the roof.</p>

<p>"It is like coal mines," he said, beginning to
crawl on hands and knees over what felt like
very prickly beach, "only we've no picks or
shovels."</p>

<p>"And no Sir Humphry Davy safety lamps,"
said Denny in sadness.</p>

<p>"They wouldn't be any good," said Oswald;
"they're only to protect the hard-working
mining men against fire-damp and choke-damp.
And there's none of those kinds
here."</p>

<p>"No," said Denny, "the damp here is only
just the common kind."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Oswald, and they crawled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
a bit further still on their furtive and unassuming
stomachs.</p>

<p>"This is a very glorious adventure. It is,
isn't it?" inquired the Dentist in breathlessness,
when the young stomachs of the young
explorers had bitten the dust for some yards
further.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oswald, encouraging the boy,
"and it's <i>your</i> find, too," he added, with
admirable fairness and justice, unusual in
one so young. "I only hope we shan't find
a mouldering skeleton buried alive behind
that door when we get to it. Come on.
What are you stopping for now?" he added
kindly.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's only cobwebs in my throat,"
Denny remarked, and he came on, though
slower than before.</p>

<p>Oswald, with his customary intrepid caution,
was leading the way, and he paused every now
and then to strike a match because it was
pitch dark, and at any moment the courageous
leader might have tumbled into a well or a
dungeon, or knocked his dauntless nose
against something in the dark.</p>

<p>"It's all right for you," he said to Denny,
when he had happened to kick his follower
in the eye. "You've nothing to fear except
my boots, and whatever they do is accidental,
and so it doesn't count, but <i>I</i> may be going
straight into some trap that has been yawning
for me for countless ages."</p>

<p>"I won't come on so fast, thank you," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the Dentist. "I don't think you've kicked
my eye out yet."</p>

<p>So they went on and on, crampedly crawling
on what I have mentioned before, and at last
Oswald did not strike the next match carefully
enough, and with the suddenness of a
falling star his hands, which, with his knees,
he was crawling on, went over the edge into
infinite space, and his chest alone, catching
sharply on the edge of the precipice, saved
him from being hurled to the bottom of it.</p>

<p>"Halt!" he cried, as soon as he had any
breath again. But, alas! it was too late!
The Dentist's nose had been too rapid, and
had caught up the boot-heel of the daring
leader. This was very annoying to Oswald,
and was not in the least his fault.</p>

<p>"Do keep your nose off my boots half a
sec.," he remarked, but not crossly. "I'll
strike a match."</p>

<p>And he did, and by its weird and unscrutatious
light looked down into the precipice.</p>

<p>Its bottom transpired to be not much more
than six feet below, so Oswald turned the
other end of himself first, hung by his hands,
and dropped with fearless promptness, uninjured,
in another cellar. He then helped
Denny down. The cornery thing Denny
happened to fall on could not have hurt
him so much as he said.</p>

<p>The light of the torch, I mean match, now
revealed to the two bold and youthful youths
another cellar, with <i>things</i> in it&mdash;very dirty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
indeed, but of thrilling interest and unusual
shapes, but the match went out before we
could see exactly what the things were.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 541px;">
<img src="images/gs18.png" width="541" height="300" alt="OSWALD DID NOT STRIKE THE NEXT MATCH CAREFULLY ENOUGH." title="OSWALD DID NOT STRIKE THE NEXT MATCH CAREFULLY ENOUGH." />
<span class="caption">OSWALD DID NOT STRIKE THE NEXT MATCH CAREFULLY ENOUGH.</span>
</div>

<p>The next match was the last but one, but
Oswald was undismayed, whatever Denny
may have been. He lighted it and looked
hastily round. There was a door.</p>

<p>"Bang on that door&mdash;over there, silly!" he
cried, in cheering accents, to his trusty
lieutenant; "behind that thing that looks
like a <i>chevaux de frize</i>."</p>

<p>Denny had never been to Woolwich, and
while Oswald was explaining what a <i>chevaux
de frize</i> is, the match burnt his fingers almost
to the bone, and he had to feel his way to the
door and hammer on it yourself.</p>

<p>The blows of the others from the other side
were deafening.</p>

<p>All was saved.</p>

<p>It was the right door.</p>

<p>"Go and ask for candles and matches,"
shouted the brave Oswald. "Tell them there
are all sorts of things in here&mdash;a <i>chevaux de
frize</i> of chair-legs, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A shovel of <i>what?</i>" asked Dicky's voice
hollowly from the other side of the door.</p>

<p>"Freeze," shouted Denny. "I don't know
what it means, but do get a candle and make
them unbarricade the door. I don't want to
go back the way we came." He said something
about Oswald's boots that he was sorry
for afterwards, so I will not repeat it, and I
don't think the others heard, because of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
noise the barrels made while they were being
climbed over.</p>

<p>This noise, however, was like balmy zephyrs
compared to the noise the barrels insisted on
making when Dicky had collected some
grown-ups and the barrels were being rolled
away. During this thunder-like interval
Denny and Oswald were all the time in the
pitch dark. They had lighted their last match,
and by its flickering gleam we saw a long,
large mangle.</p>

<p>"It's like a double coffin," said Oswald, as
the match went out. "You can take my arm
if you like, Dentist."</p>

<p>The Dentist did&mdash;and then afterwards he
said he only did it because he thought Oswald
was frightened of the dark.</p>

<p>"It's only for a little while," said Oswald in
the pauses of the barrel-thunder, "and I once
read about two brothers confined for life in a
cage so constructed that the unfortunate
prisoners could neither sit, lie, nor stand in
comfort. We can do all those things."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Denny; "but I'd rather keep on
standing if it's the same to you, Oswald. I
don't like spiders&mdash;not much, that is."</p>

<p>"You are right," said Oswald with affable
gentleness; "and there might be toads perhaps
in a vault like this&mdash;or serpents guarding the
treasure like in the Cold Lairs. But of course
they couldn't have cobras in England. They'd
have to put up with vipers, I suppose."</p>

<p>Denny shivered, and Oswald could feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
him stand first on one leg and then on the
other.</p>

<p>"I wish I could stand on neither of my legs
for a bit," he said, but Oswald answered firmly
that this could not be.</p>

<p>And then the door opened with a crack-crash,
and we saw lights and faces through it,
and something fell from the top of the door that
Oswald really did think for one awful instant
was a hideous mass of writhing serpents put
there to guard the entrance.</p>

<p>"Like a sort of live booby-trap," he
explained; "just the sort of thing a magician
or a witch would have thought of doing."</p>

<p>But it was only dust and cobwebs&mdash;a thick,
damp mat of them.</p>

<p>Then the others surged in, in light-hearted
misunderstanding of the perils Oswald had
led Denny into&mdash;I mean through, with Mr.
Red House and another gentleman, and loud
voices and candles that dripped all over everybody's
hands, as well as their clothes, and the
solitary confinement of the gallant Oswald
was at an end. Denny's solitary confinement
was at an end, too&mdash;and he was now able to
stand on both legs and to let go the arm of
his leader who was so full of fortitude.</p>

<p>"This <i>is</i> a find," said the pleased voice of
Mr. Red House. "Do you know, we've been
in this house six whole months and a bit,
and <i>we</i> never thought of there being a door
here."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't often play 'King of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Castle,'" said Dora politely; "it <i>is</i> rather a
rough game, I always think."</p>

<p>"Well, curiously enough, we never have,"
said Mr. Red House, beginning to lift out the
chairs, in which avocation we all helped, of
course.</p>

<p>"Nansen is nothing to you! You ought to
have a medal for daring explorations," said
the other gentleman, but nobody gave us one,
and, of course, we did not want any reward
for doing our duty, however tight and cobwebby.</p>

<p>The cellars proved to be well stocked with
spiders and old furniture, but no toads or
snakes, which few, if any, regretted. Snakes
are outcasts from human affection. Oswald
pities them, of course.</p>

<p>There was a great lumpish thing in four
parts that Mr. Red House said was a press,
and a ripping settle&mdash;besides the chairs, and
some carved wood that Mr. Red House and
his friend made out to be part of an old four-post
bed. There was also a wooden thing like
a box with another box on it at one end, and
H.O. said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You could make a ripping rabbit-hutch
out of that."</p>

<p>Oswald thought so himself. But Mr. Red
House said he had other uses for it, and
would bring it up later.</p>

<p>It took us all that was left of the afternoon
to get the things up the stairs into the kitchen.
It was hard work, but we know all about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
dignity of labour. The general hated the
things we had so enterprisingly discovered.
I suppose she knew who would have to clean
them, but Mrs. Red House was awfully pleased
and said we were dears.</p>

<p>We were not very clean dears by the time
our work was done, and when the other
gentleman said, "Won't you all take a dish
of tea under my humble roof?" the words
"Like this?" were formed by more than one
youthful voice.</p>

<p>"Well, if you would be happier in a
partially cleansed state?" said Mr. Red House.
And Mrs. Red House, who is my idea of a
feudal lady in a castle, said, "Oh, come along,
let's go and partially clean ourselves. I'm
dirtier than anybody, though I haven't
explored a bit. I've often noticed that the
more you admire things the more they come
off on you!"</p>

<p>So we all washed as much as we cared to,
and went to tea at the gentleman's house,
which was only a cottage, but very beautiful.
He had been a war correspondent, and he
knew a great many things, besides having
books and books of pictures.</p>

<p>It was a splendid party.</p>

<p>We thanked Mrs. R.H. and everybody when
it was time to go, and she kissed the girls and
the little boys, and then she put her head on
one side and looked at Oswald and said, "I
suppose you're too old?"</p>

<p>Oswald did not like to say he was not. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
kissed at all he would prefer it being for some
other reason than his being not too old for it.
So he did not know what to say. But No&euml;l
chipped in with&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>You'll</i> never be too old for it," to Mrs. Red
House&mdash;which seemed to Oswald most silly
and unmeaning, because she was already much
too old to be kissed by people unless she chose
to begin it. But every one seemed to think
No&euml;l had said something clever. And Oswald
felt like a young ass. But Mrs. R.H. looked
at him so kindly and held out her hand so
queenily that, before he knew he meant to, he
had kissed it like you do the Queen's. Then,
of course, Denny and Dicky went and did the
same. Oswald wishes that the word "kiss"
might never be spoken again in this world.
Not that he minded kissing Mrs. Red House's
hand in the least, especially as she seemed to
think it was nice of him to&mdash;but the whole
thing is such contemptible piffle.</p>

<p>We were seen home by the gentleman who
wasn't Mr. Red House, and he stood a glorious
cab with a white horse who had a rolling eye,
from Blackheath Station, and so ended one of
the most adventuring times we ever got out
of a play-beginning.</p>

<p>The <i>time</i> ended as the author has pointed
out, but not its resultingness. Thus we ever
find it in life&mdash;the most unharmful things,
thoroughly approved even by grown-ups, but
too often lead to something quite different,
and that no one can possibly approve of, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
even yourself when you come to think it over
afterwards, like No&euml;l and H.O. had to.</p>

<p>It was but natural that the hearts of the
young explorers should have dwelt fondly on
everything underground, even drains, which
was what made us read a book by Mr. Hugo,
all the next day. It is called "The Miserables,"
in French, and the man in it, who is a splendid
hero, though a convict and a robber and
various other professions, escapes into a drain
with great rats in it, and is miraculously
restored to the light of day, unharmed by the
kindly rodents. (N.B.&mdash;Rodents mean rats.)</p>

<p>When we had finished all the part about
drains it was nearly dinner-time, and No&euml;l
said quite suddenly in the middle of a bite
of mutton&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Red House isn't nearly so red as ours
is outside. Why should the cellars be so much
cellarier? Shut up H.O.!" For H.O. was trying
to speak.</p>

<p>Dora explained to him how we don't all
have exactly the same blessings, but he didn't
seem to see it.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem like the way things happen
in books," he said, "In Walter Scott it
wouldn't be like that, nor yet in Anthony
Hope. I should think the rule would be the
redder the cellarier. If I was putting it into
poetry I should make our cellars have something
much wonderfuller in them than just
wooden things. H.O., if you don't shut up I'll
never let you be in anything again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's that door you go down steps to,"
said Dicky; "we've never been in there. If
Dora and I weren't going with Miss Blake to
be fitted for boots we might try that."</p>

<p>"That's just what I was coming to. (Stow
it, H.O.!) I felt just like cellars to-day, while
you other chaps were washing your hands for
din.&mdash;and it was very cold; but I made H.O.
feel the same, and we went down, and&mdash;that
door <i>isn't shut now</i>."</p>

<p>The intelligible reader may easily guess that
we finished our dinner as quickly as we could,
and we put on our outers, sympathising with
Dicky and Dora, who, owing to boots, were
out of it, and we went into the garden. There
are five steps down to that door. They were
red brick when they began, but now they are
green with age and mysteriousness and not
being walked on. And at the bottom of them
the door was, as No&euml;l said, not fastened. We
went in.</p>

<p>"It isn't beery, winey cellars at all," Alice
said; "it's more like a robber's store-house.
Look there."</p>

<p>We had got to the inner cellar, and there
were heaps of carrots and other vegetables.</p>

<p>"Halt, my men!" cried Oswald, "advance
not an inch further! The bandits may lurk
not a yard from you!"</p>

<p>"Suppose they jump out on us?" said H.O.</p>

<p>"They will not rashly leap into the light,"
said the discerning Oswald. And he went to
fetch a new dark-lantern of his that he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
not had any chance of really using before.
But some one had taken Oswald's secret
matches, and then the beastly lantern wouldn't
light for ever so long. But he thought it
didn't matter his being rather a long time
gone, because the others could pass the time
in wondering whether anything would jump
out on them, and if so, what and when.</p>

<p>So when he got back to the red steps and
the open door and flashed his glorious bull's-eye
round it was rather an annoying thing
for there not to be a single other eye for it
to flash into. Every one had vanished.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" cried Oswald, and if his gallant
voice trembled he is not ashamed of it, because
he knows about wells in cellars, and, for an
instant, even he did not know what had
happened.</p>

<p>But an answering hullo came from beyond,
and he hastened after the others.</p>

<p>"Look out," said Alice; "don't tumble over
that heap of bones."</p>

<p>Oswald did look out&mdash;of course, he would
not wish to walk on any one's bones. But he
did not jump back with a scream, whatever
No&euml;l may say when he is in a temper.</p>

<p>The heap really did look very like bones,
partly covered with earth. Oswald was glad
to learn that they were only parsnips.</p>

<p>"We waited as long as we could," said
Alice, "but we thought perhaps you'd been
collared for some little thing you'd forgotten
all about doing, and wouldn't be able to come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
back, but we found No&euml;l had, fortunately, got
your matches. I'm so glad you weren't collared,
Oswald dear."</p>

<p>Some boys would have let No&euml;l know about
the matches, but Oswald didn't. The heaps
of carrots and turnips and parsnips and things
were not very interesting when you knew
that they were not bleeding warriors' or
pilgrims' bones, and it was too cold to pretend
for long with any comfort to the young
Pretenders. So Oswald said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let's go out on the Heath and play something
warm. You can't warm yourself with
matches, even if they're not your own."</p>

<p>That was all he said. A great hero would
not stoop to argue about matches.</p>

<p>And Alice said, "All right," and she and
Oswald went out and played pretending golf
with some walking-sticks of Father's. But
No&euml;l and H.O. preferred to sit stuffily over the
common-room fire. So that Oswald and Alice,
as well as Dora and Dicky, who were being
measured for boots, were entirely out of the
rest of what happened, and the author can
only imagine the events that now occurred.</p>

<p>When No&euml;l and H.O. had roasted their
legs by the fire till they were so hot that their
stockings quite hurt them, one of them must
have said to the other&mdash;I never knew which:</p>

<p>"Let's go and have another look at that
cellar."</p>

<p>The other&mdash;whoever it was&mdash;foolishly consented.
So they went, and they took Oswald's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
dark-lantern in his absence and without his
leave.</p>

<p>They found a hitherto unnoticed door behind
the other one, and No&euml;l says he said, "We'd
better not go in." H.O. says he said so too.
But any way, they <i>did</i> go in.</p>

<p>They found themselves in a small vaulted
place that we found out afterwards had been
used for mushrooms. But it was long since
any fair bud of a mushroom had blossomed in
that dark retreat. The place had been cleaned
and new shelves put up, and when No&euml;l and
H.O. saw what was on these shelves the
author is sure they turned pale, though they
say not.</p>

<p>For what they saw was coils, and pots, and
wires; and one of them said, in a voice that
must have trembled&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is dynamite, I am certain of it; what
shall we do?"</p>

<p>I am certain the other said, "This is to
blow up Father because he took part in the
Lewisham Election, and his side won."</p>

<p>The reply no doubt was, "There is no time
for delay; we must act. We must cut the
fuse&mdash;all the fuses; there are dozens."</p>

<p>Oswald thinks it was not half bad business,
those two kids&mdash;for No&euml;l is little more than
one, owing to his poetry and his bronchitis&mdash;standing
in the abode of dynamite and not
screeching, or running off to tell Miss Blake,
or the servants, or any one&mdash;but just doing
<i>the right thing</i> without any fuss.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 276px;">
<img src="images/gs19.png" width="276" height="500" alt="WITH SCISSORS AND GAS PLIERS THEY CUT EVERY FUSE." title="WITH SCISSORS AND GAS PLIERS THEY CUT EVERY FUSE." />
<span class="caption">WITH SCISSORS AND GAS PLIERS THEY CUT EVERY FUSE.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>I need hardly say it did not prove to be the
right thing&mdash;but they thought it was. And
Oswald cannot think that you are really doing
wrong if you really think you are doing right.
I hope you will understand this.</p>

<p>I believe the kids tried cutting the fuses
with Dick's pocket-knife that was in the
pocket of his other clothes. But the fuses
would not&mdash;no matter how little you trembled
when you touched them.</p>

<p>But at last, with scissors and the gas pliers,
they cut every fuse. The fuses were long,
twisty, wire things covered with green wool,
like blind-cords.</p>

<p>Then No&euml;l and H.O. (and Oswald for one
thinks it showed a goodish bit of pluck, and
policemen have been made heroes for less) got
cans and cans of water from the tap by the
greenhouse and poured sluicing showers of
the icy fluid in among the internal machinery
of the dynamite arrangement&mdash;for so they
believed it to be.</p>

<p>Then, very wet, but feeling that they had
saved their Father and the house, they went
and changed their clothes. I think they were
a little stuck-up about it, believing it to be an
act unrivalled in devotedness, and they were
most tiresome all the afternoon, talking about
their secret, and not letting us know what
it was.</p>

<p>But when Father came home, early, as it
happened, those swollen-headed, but, in
Oswald's opinion, quite-to-be-excused, kiddies
learned the terrible truth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course Oswald and Dicky would have
known at once; if No&euml;l and H.O. hadn't been
so cocky about not telling us, we could have
exposed the truth to them in all its uninteresting
nature.</p>

<p>I hope the reader will now prepare himself
for a shock. In a wild whirl of darkness, and
the gas being cut off, and not being able to get
any light, and Father saying all sorts of things,
it all came out.</p>

<p>Those coils and jars and wires in that cellar
were not an infernal machine at all. It was&mdash;I
know you will be very much surprised&mdash;it
was the electric lights and bells that Father
had had put in while we were at the Red
House the day before.</p>

<p>H.O. and No&euml;l caught it very fully; and
Oswald thinks this was one of the few occasions
when my Father was not as just as he
meant to be. My uncle was not just either,
but then it is much longer since he was a boy,
so we must make excuses for him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We sent Mrs. Red House a Christmas card
each. In spite of the trouble that her cellars
had lured him into, No&euml;l sent her a homemade
one with an endless piece of his everlasting
poetry on it, and next May she wrote
and asked us to come and see her. <i>We</i> try to
be just, and we saw that it was not really her
fault that No&euml;l and H.O. had cut those electric
wires, so we all went; but we did not take
Albert Morrison, because he was fortunately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
away with an aged god-parent of his mother's
who writes tracts at Tunbridge Wells.</p>

<p>The garden was all flowery and green, and
Mr. and Mrs. Red House were nice and jolly,
and we had a distinguished and first-class
time.</p>

<p>But would you believe it?&mdash;that boxish thing
in the cellar, that H.O. wanted them to make
a rabbit-hutch of&mdash;well, Mr. Red House had
cleaned it and mended it, and Mrs. Red House
took us up to the room where it was, to let us
look at it again. And, unbelievable to relate,
it turned out to have rockers, and some one in
dark, bygone ages seems, for reasons unknown
to the present writer, to have wasted no end
of carpentry and carving on it, just to make
it into a <i>Cradle</i>. And what is more, since we
were there last Mr. and Mrs. Red House had
succeeded in obtaining a small but quite alive
baby to put in it.</p>

<p>I suppose they thought it was wilful waste
to have a cradle and no baby to use it. But it
could so easily have been used for something
else. It would have made a ripping rabbit-hutch,
and babies are far more trouble than
rabbits to keep, and not nearly so profitable, I
believe.</p>

<h2><i>THE TURK IN CHAINS; OR,<br />
RICHARD'S REVENGE</i></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> morning dawned in cloudless splendour.
The sky was a pale cobalt colour, as in
pictures of Swiss scenery. The sun shone
brightly, and all the green things in the
garden sparkled in the bewitching rays of the
monarch of the skies.</div>

<p>The author of this does not like to read
much about the weather in books, but he is
obliged to put this piece in because it is true;
and it is a thing that does not very often
happen in the middle of January. In fact, I
never remember the weather being at all like
that in the winter except on that one day.</p>

<p>Of course we all went into the garden
directly after brekker. (PS.&mdash;I have said
green things: perhaps you think that is a
<i>lapsus lazuli</i>, or slip of the tongue, and that
there are not any green things in the winter.
But there are. And not just evergreens
either. Wallflowers and pansies and snapdragons
and primroses, and lots of things,
keep green all the year unless it's too frosty.
Live and learn.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>And it was so warm we were able to sit in
the summer-house. The birds were singing
like mad. Perhaps they thought it was
springtime. Or perhaps they <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'alway'">always</ins> sing
when they see the sun, without paying attention
to dates.</p>

<p>And now, when all his brothers and sisters
were sitting on the rustic seats in the summer-house,
the far-sighted Oswald suddenly saw
that now was the moment for him to hold
that council he had been wanting to hold for
some time.</p>

<p>So he stood in the door of the summer-house,
in case any of the others should
suddenly remember that they wanted to be in
some other place. And he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say. About that council I want to hold."</p>

<p>And Dicky replied: "Well, what about it?"</p>

<p>So then Oswald explained all over again
that we had been Treasure Seekers, and we
had been Would-be-Goods, and he thought it
was time we were something else.</p>

<p>"Being something else makes you think of
things," he said at the end of all the other
things he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," said H.O., yawning, without putting
up his hand, which is not manners, and we
told him so. "But <i>I</i> can think of things without
being other things. Look how I thought
about being a clown, and going to Rome."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you would want us to
remember <i>that</i>," said Dora. And indeed
Father had not been pleased with H.O. about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that affair. But Oswald never encourages
Dora to nag, so he said patiently&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, you think of things you'd much better
not have thought of. Now my idea is let's
each say what sort of a society we shall make
ourselves into&mdash;like we did when we were
Treasure Seekers&mdash;about the different ways
to look for it, I mean. Let's hold our tongues
(no, not with your dirty fingers, H.O., old chap;
hold it with your teeth if you must hold it
with something)&mdash;let's hold our tongues for a
bit, and then all say what we've thought of&mdash;in
ages," the thoughtful boy added hastily, so
that every one should not speak at once when
we had done holding our tongues.</p>

<p>So we were all silent, and the birds sang
industriously among the leafless trees of our
large sunny garden in beautiful Blackheath.
(The author is sorry to see he is getting
poetical. It shall not happen again, and it
<i>was</i> an extra fine day, really, and the birds
did sing, a fair treat.)</p>

<p>When three long minutes had elapsed
themselves by the hands of Oswald's watch,
which always keeps perfect time for three or
four days after he has had it mended, he
closed the watch and observed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Time! Go ahead, Dora."</p>

<p>Dora went ahead in the following remarks:</p>

<p>"I've thought as hard as I can, and nothing
will come into my head except&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever.'<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></div>

<div class='unindent'>Don't you think we might try to find some
new ways to be good in?"</div>

<p>"No, you don't!" "I bar that!" came at
once from the mouths of Dicky and Oswald.</p>

<p>"You don't come that over us twice," Dicky
added. And Oswald eloquently said, "No
more Would-be-Goods, thank you, Dora."</p>

<p>Dora said, well, she couldn't think of anything
else. And she didn't expect Oswald had
thought of anything better.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," replied her brother. "What
I think is that we don't <i>know</i> half enough."</p>

<p>"If you mean extra swat," said Alice;
"I've more homers than I care for already,
thank you."</p>

<p>"I do not mean swat," rejoined the experienced
Oswald. "I want to know all
about real things, not booky things. If you
kids had known about electric bells you
wouldn't have&mdash;&mdash;" Oswald stopped, and
then said, "I won't say any more, because
Father says a gentleman does not support his
arguments with personal illusions to other
people's faults and follies."</p>

<p>"Faults and follies yourself," said H.O. The
girls restored peace, and Oswald went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us seek to grow wiser, and to teach
each other."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> bar that," said H.O. "I don't want
Oswald and Dicky always on to me and call
it teaching."</p>

<p>"We might call the society the Would-be-Wisers,"
said Oswald hastily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's not so dusty," said Dicky; "let's go on
to the others before we decide."</p>

<p>"You're next yourself," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Oh, so I am," remarked Dicky, trying to
look surprised. "Well, my idea is let's be
a sort of Industrious Society of Beavers, and
make a solemn vow and covenant to make
something every day. We might call it the
Would-be-Clevers."</p>

<p>"It would be the Too-clever-by-half's before
we'd done with it," said Oswald.</p>

<p>And Alice said, "We couldn't always make
things that would be any good, and then we
should have to do something that wasn't any
good, and that would be rot. Yes, I know
it's my turn&mdash;H.O., you'll kick the table to
pieces if you go on like that. Do, for goodness'
sake, keep your feet still. The only thing
I can think of is a society called the Would-be-Boys."</p>

<p>"With you and Dora for members."</p>

<p>"And No&euml;l&mdash;poets aren't boys exactly," said
H.O.</p>

<p>"If you don't shut up you shan't be in it
at all," said Alice, putting her arm round No&euml;l.
"No; I meant us all to be in it&mdash;only you
boys are not to keep saying we're only girls,
and let us do everything the same as you
boys do."</p>

<p>"I don't want to be a boy, thank you," said
Dora, "not when I see how they behave.
H.O., <i>do</i> stop sniffing and use your handkerchief.
Well, take mine, then."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>It was now No&euml;l's turn to disclose his idea,
which proved most awful.</p>

<p>"Let's be Would-be-Poets," he said, "and
solemnly vow and convenient to write one
piece of poetry a day as long as we live."</p>

<p>Most of us were dumb at the dreadful
thought. But Alice said&mdash;</p>

<p>"That would never do, No&euml;l dear, because
you're the only one of us who's clever enough
to do it."</p>

<p>So No&euml;l's detestable and degrading idea was
shelved without Oswald having to say anything
that would have made the youthful
poet weep.</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't mean me to say what
I thought of," said H.O., "but I shall. I
think you ought all to be in a Would-be-Kind
Society, and vow solemn convents and things
not to be down on your younger brother."</p>

<p>We explained to him at once that <i>he</i>
couldn't be in that, because he hadn't got a
younger brother.</p>

<p>"And you may think yourself lucky you
haven't," Dicky added.</p>

<p>The ingenious and felicitous Oswald was
just going to begin about the council all over
again, when the portable form of our Indian
uncle came stoutly stumping down the garden
path under the cedars.</p>

<p>"Hi, brigands!" he cried in his cheerful
unclish manner. "Who's on for the Hippodrome
this bright day?"</p>

<p>And instantly we all were. Even Oswald&mdash;because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
after all you can have a council any
day, but Hippodromes are not like that.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/gs20.png" width="363" height="500" alt="&quot;HI, BRIGANDS!&quot; HE CRIED." title="&quot;HI, BRIGANDS!&quot; HE CRIED." />
<span class="caption">&quot;HI, BRIGANDS!&quot; HE CRIED.</span>
</div>

<p>We got ready like the whirlwind of the
desert for quickness, and started off with our
kind uncle, who has lived so long in India
that he is much more warm-hearted than you
would think to look at him.</p>

<p>Half-way to the station Dicky remembered
his patent screw for working ships with. He
had been messing with it in the bath while he
was waiting for Oswald to have done plunging
cleanly in the basin. And in the desert-whirlwinding
he had forgotten to take it out.
So now he ran back, because he knew how its
cardboardiness would turn to pulp if it was
left.</p>

<p>"I'll catch you up," he cried.</p>

<p>The uncle took the tickets and the train
came in and still Dicky had not caught
us up.</p>

<p>"Tiresome boy!" said the uncle; "you don't
want to miss the beginning&mdash;eh, what? Ah,
here he comes!" The uncle got in, and so did
we, but Dicky did not see the uncle's newspaper
which Oswald waved, and he went
running up and down the train looking for us
instead of just getting in anywhere sensibly,
as Oswald would have done. When the train
began to move he did try to open a carriage
door but it stuck, and the train went faster,
and just as he got it open a large heavy
porter caught him by the collar and pulled
him off the train, saying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, young shaver, no susansides on this
ere line, if <i>you</i> please."</p>

<p>Dicky hit the porter, but his fury was vain.
Next moment the train had passed away, and
us in it. Dicky had no money, and the uncle
had all the tickets in the pocket of his fur
coat.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I am not going to tell you anything about
the Hippodrome because the author feels that
it was a trifle beastly of us to have enjoyed it
as much as we did considering Dicky. We
tried not to talk about it before him when we
got home, but it was very difficult&mdash;especially
the elephants.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I suppose he spent an afternoon of bitter
thoughts after he had told that porter what
he thought of him, which took some time, and
the station-master interfered in the end.</p>

<p>When we got home he was all right with
us. He had had time to see it was not our
faults, whatever he thought at the time.</p>

<p>He refused to talk about it. Only he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm going to take it out of that porter.
You leave me alone. I shall think of something
presently."</p>

<p>"Revenge is very wrong," said Dora; but
even Alice asked her kindly to dry up. We
all felt that it was simply piffle to talk
copy-book to one so disappointed as our
unfortunate brother.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> wrong, though," said Dora.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wrong be blowed!" said Dicky, snorting;
"who began it I should like to know! The
station's a beastly awkward place to take it
out of any one in. I wish I knew where he
lived."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> know <i>that</i>," said No&euml;l. "I've known it
a long time&mdash;before Christmas, when we were
going to the Moat House."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, then?" asked Dicky
savagely.</p>

<p>"Don't bite his head off," remarked Alice.
"Tell us about it, No&euml;l. How do you know?"</p>

<p>"It was when you were weighing yourselves
on the weighing machine. I didn't because
my weight isn't worth being weighed for.
And there was a heap of hampers and turkeys
and hares and things, and there was a label
on a turkey and brown-paper parcel; and
that porter that you hate so said to the other
porter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hurry up, do!" said Dicky.</p>

<p>"I won't tell you at all if you bully me,"
said No&euml;l, and Alice had to coax him before he
would go on.</p>

<p>"Well, he looked at the label and said,
'Little mistake here, Bill&mdash;wrong address;
ought to be 3, Abel Place, eh?'</p>

<p>"And the other one looked, and he said,
'Yes; it's got your name right enough. Fine
turkey, too, and his chains in the parcel.
Pity they ain't more careful about addressing
things, eh?' So when they had done laughing
about it I looked at the label and it said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
'James Johnson, 8, Granville Park.' So I
knew it was 3, Abel Place, he lived at, and
his name was James Johnson."</p>

<p>"Good old Sherlock Holmes!" said Oswald.</p>

<p>"You won't really <i>hurt</i> him," said No&euml;l,
"will you? Not Corsican revenge with knives,
or poisoned bowls? I wouldn't do more than
a good booby-trap, if I was you."</p>

<p>When No&euml;l said the word "booby-trap,"
we all saw a strange, happy look come over
Dicky's face. It is called a far-away look, I
believe, and you can see it in the picture of a
woman cuddling a photograph-album with
her hair down, that is in all the shops, and
they call it "The Soul's Awakening."</p>

<p>Directly Dicky's soul had finished waking
up he shut his teeth together with a click.
Then he said, "I've got it."</p>

<p>Of course we all knew that.</p>

<p>"Any one who thinks revenge is wrong is
asked to leave <i>now</i>."</p>

<p>Dora said he was very unkind, and did he
really want to turn her out?</p>

<p>"There's a jolly good fire in Father's study,"
he said. "No, I'm not waxy with you, but
I'm going to have my revenge, and I don't
want you to do anything you thought wrong.
You'd only make no end of a fuss afterwards."</p>

<p>"Well, it <i>is</i> wrong, so I'll go," said Dora.
"Don't say I didn't warn you, that's all!"</p>

<p>And she went.</p>

<p>Then Dicky said, "Now, any more conscious
objectors?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>And when no one replied he went on: "It
was you saying 'Booby-trap' gave me the idea.
His name's James Johnson, is it? And he
said the things were addressed wrong, did he?
Well, <i>I'll</i> send him a Turkey-and-chains."</p>

<p>"A Turk in chains," said No&euml;l, growing
owley-eyed at the thought&mdash;"a <i>live</i> Turk&mdash;or&mdash;no,
not a dead one, Dicky?"</p>

<p>"The Turk I'm going to send won't be a live
one nor yet a dead one."</p>

<p>"How horrible! <i>Half</i> dead. That's worse
than anything," and No&euml;l became so green in
the face that Alice told Dicky to stop playing
the goat, and tell us what his idea really was.</p>

<p>"Don't you see <i>yet?</i>" he cried; "<i>I</i> saw it
directly."</p>

<p>"I daresay," said Oswald; "it's easy to see
your own idea. Drive ahead."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to get a hamper and pack
it full of parcels and put a list of them on
the top&mdash;beginning Turk-and-chains, and send
it to Mister James Johnson, and when he
opens the parcels there'll be nothing inside."</p>

<p>"There must be something, you know," said
H.O., "or the parcels won't be any shape
except flatness."</p>

<p>"Oh, there'll be <i>something</i> right enough,"
was the bitter reply of the one who had not
been to the Hippodrome, "but it won't be the
sort of something he'll expect it to be. Let's
do it now. I'll get a hamper."</p>


<p>He got a big one out of the cellar and four
empty bottles with their straw cases. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
filled the bottles with black ink and water,
and red ink and water, and soapy water, and
water plain. And we put them down on the
list&mdash;</p>

<span class="caption">IT WAS RATHER DIFFICULT TO GET ANYTHING THE SHAPE OF A TURKEY.</span>
</div>

<div class='poem'>
1 bottle of port wine.<br />
1 bottle of sherry wine.<br />
1 bottle of sparkling champagne.<br />
1 bottle of rum.<br />
</div>

<p>The rest of the things we put on the list
were&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
1 turkey-and-chains.<br />
2 pounds of chains.<br />
1 plum-pudding.<br />
4 pounds of mince-pies.<br />
2 pounds of almonds and raisins.<br />
1 box of figs.<br />
1 bottle of French plums.<br />
1 large cake.<br />
</div>

<p>And we made up parcels to look outside
as if their inside was full of the delicious
attributes described in the list. It was rather
difficult to get anything the shape of a turkey
but with coals and crushed newspapers and
firewood we did it, and when it was done
up with lots of string and the paper artfully
squeezed tight to the firewood to look like
the Turk's legs it really was almost lifelike
in its deceivingness. The chains, or sausages,
we did with dusters&mdash;and not clean ones&mdash;rolled
tight, and the paper moulded gently to
their forms. The plum-pudding was a newspaper
ball. The mince-pies were newspapers
too, and so were the almonds and raisins. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
box of figs was a real fig-box with cinders and
ashes in it damped to keep them from rattling
about. The French-plum bottle was real too.
It had newspaper soaked in ink in it, and
the cake was half a muff-box of Dora's done
up very carefully and put at the bottom of
the hamper. Inside the muff-box we put a
paper with&mdash;</p>

<p>"Revenge is not wrong when the other
people begin. It was you began, and now you
are jolly well served out."</p>

<p>We packed all the bottles and parcels into
the hamper, and put the list on the very top,
pinned to the paper that covered the false
breast of the imitation Turk.</p>

<p>Dicky wanted to write&mdash;"From an unknown
friend," but we did not think that was fair,
considering how Dicky felt.</p>

<p>So at last we put&mdash;"From one who does not
wish to sign his name."</p>

<p>And that was true, at any rate.</p>

<p>Dicky and Oswald lugged the hamper down
to the shop that has Carter Paterson's board
outside.</p>

<p>"I vote we don't pay the carriage," said
Dicky, but that was perhaps because he was
still so very angry about being pulled off the
train. Oswald had not had it done to him,
so he said that we ought to pay the carriage.
And he was jolly glad afterwards that this
honourable feeling had arisen in his young
bosom, and that he had jolly well made Dicky
let it rise in his.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>We paid the carriage. It was one-and-five-pence,
but Dicky said it was cheap for a high-class
revenge like this, and after all it was his
money the carriage was paid with.</p>

<p>So then we went home and had another go
in of grub&mdash;because tea had been rather upset
by Dicky's revenge.</p>

<p>The people where we left the hamper told
us that it would be delivered next day. So
next morning we gloated over the thought
of the sell that porter was in for, and Dicky
was more deeply gloating than any one.</p>

<p>"I expect it's got there by now," he said
at dinner-time; "it's a first class booby-trap;
what a sell for him! He'll read the list and
then he'll take out one parcel after another
till he comes to the cake. It <i>was</i> a ripping
idea! I'm glad I thought of it!"</p>

<p>"I'm not," said No&euml;l suddenly. "I wish
you hadn't&mdash;I wish we hadn't. I know just
exactly what he feels like now. He feels
as if he'd like to <i>kill</i> you for it, and I daresay
he would if you hadn't been a craven,
white-feathered skulker and not signed your
name."</p>

<p>It was a thunderbolt in our midst No&euml;l
behaving like this. It made Oswald feel a
sick inside feeling that perhaps Dora had
been right. She sometimes is&mdash;and Oswald
hates this feeling.</p>

<p>Dicky was so surprised at the unheard-of
cheek of his young brother that for a moment
he was speechless, and before he got over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
his speechlessness No&euml;l was crying and
wouldn't have any more dinner. Alice spoke
in the eloquent language of the human eye
and begged Dicky to look over it this once.
And he replied by means of the same useful
organ that he didn't care what a silly kid
thought. So no more was said. When No&euml;l
had done crying he began to write a piece
of poetry and kept at it all the afternoon.
Oswald only saw just the beginning. It was
called</p>

<div class='center'>
"THE DISAPPOINTED PORTER'S FURY<br />
<br />
<i>Supposed to be by the Porter himself</i>,"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and it began:&mdash;</div>

<div class='poem'>
"When first I opened the hamper fair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And saw the parcel inside there</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My heart rejoiced like dry gardens when</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It rains&mdash;but soon I changed and then</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I seized my trusty knife and bowl</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of poison, and said 'Upon the whole</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I will have the life of the man</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or woman who thought of this wicked plan</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To deceive a trusting porter so.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No noble heart would have thought of it. No.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>There were pages and pages of it. Of
course it was all nonsense&mdash;the poetry, I
mean. And yet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (I have seen
that put in books when the author does
not want to let out all he thought at the
time.)</p>

<p>That evening at tea-time Jane came and
said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Master Dicky, there's an old aged man
at the door inquiring if you live here."</p>

<p>So Dicky thought it was the bootmaker
perhaps; so he went out, and Oswald went
with him, because he wanted to ask for a
bit of cobbler's wax.</p>

<p>But it was not the shoemaker. It was an
old man, pale in the face and white in the
hair, and he was so old that we asked him
into Father's study by the fire, as soon as
we had found out it was really Dicky he
wanted to see.</p>

<p>When we got him there he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Might I trouble you to shut the door?"</p>

<p>This is the way a burglar or a murderer
might behave, but we did not think he was
one. He looked too old for these professions.</p>

<p>When the door was shut, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I ain't got much to say, young gemmen.
It's only to ask was it you sent this?"</p>

<p>He pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket,
and it was our list. Oswald and Dicky looked
at each other.</p>

<p>"Did you send it?" said the old man
again.</p>

<p>So then Dicky shrugged his shoulders and
said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Oswald said, "How did you know and who
are you?"</p>

<p>The old man got whiter than ever. He
pulled out a piece of paper&mdash;it was the
greenish-grey piece we'd wrapped the Turk
and chains in. And it had a label on it that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
we hadn't noticed, with Dicky's name and
address on it. The new bat he got at
Christmas had come in it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">

<span class="caption">WHEN THE DOOR WAS SHUT HE SAID, &quot;I AIN&#39;T GOT MUCH TO SAY, YOUNG GEMMEN.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"That's how I know," said the old man.
"Ah, be sure your sin will find you out."</p>

<p>"But who are you, anyway!" asked Oswald
again.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>I</i> ain't nobody in particular," he said.
"I'm only the father of the pore gell as you
took in with your cruel, deceitful, lying tricks.
Oh, you may look uppish, young sir, but I'm
here to speak my mind, and I'll speak it if
I die for it. So now!"</p>

<p>"But we didn't send it to a girl," said
Dicky. "We wouldn't do such a thing.
We sent it for a&mdash;for a&mdash;&mdash;" I think he
tried to say for a joke, but he couldn't
with the fiery way the old man looked at
him&mdash;"for a sell, to pay a porter out for
stopping me getting into a train when it was
just starting, and I missed going to the
Circus with the others." Oswald was glad
Dicky was not too proud to explain to the
old man. He was rather afraid he might
be.</p>

<p>"I never sent it to a girl," he said again.</p>

<p>"Ho," said the aged one. "An' who told
you that there porter was a single man?
It was his wife&mdash;my pore gell&mdash;as opened
your low parcel, and she sees your lying
list written out so plain on top, and, sez she
to me, 'Father,' says she, 'ere's a friend in
need! All these good things for us, and no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
name signed, so that we can't even say thank
you. I suppose it's some one knows how
short we are just now, and hardly enough to
eat with coals the price they are,' says she
to me. 'I do call that kind and Christian,'
says she, 'and I won't open not one of them
lovely parcels till Jim comes 'ome,' she says,
'and we'll enjoy the pleasures of it together,
all three of us,' says she. And when he came
home&mdash;we opened of them lovely parcels.
She's a cryin' her eyes out at home now, and
Jim, he only swore once, and I don't blame
him for that one&mdash;though never an evil
speaker myself&mdash;and then he set himself
down on a chair and puts his elbows on it
to hide his face like&mdash;and 'Emmie,' says he,
'so help me. I didn't know I'd got an enemy
in the world. I always thought we'd got
nothing but good friends,' says he. An' I
says nothing, but I picks up the paper, and
comes here to your fine house to tell you
what I think of you. It's a mean, low-down,
dirty, nasty trick, and no gentleman wouldn't
a-done it. So that's all&mdash;and it's off my chest,
and good-night to you gentlemen both!"</p>

<p>He turned to go out. I shall not tell you
what Oswald felt, except that he did hope
Dicky felt the same, and would behave
accordingly. And Dicky did, and Oswald was
both pleased and surprised.</p>

<p>Dicky said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, stop a minute. I didn't think
of your poor girl."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"And her youngest but a bare three weeks
old," said the old man angrily.</p>

<p>"I didn't, on my honour I didn't think of
anything but paying the porter out."</p>

<p>"He was only a doing of his duty," the old
man said.</p>

<p>"Well, I beg your pardon and his," said
Dicky; "it was ungentlemanly, and I'm very
sorry. And I'll try to make it up somehow.
Please make it up. I can't do more than own
I'm sorry. I wish I hadn't&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the old man slowly, "we'll
leave it at that. Next time p'r'aps you'll
think a bit who it's going to be as'll get the
benefit of your payings out."</p>

<p>Dicky made him shake hands, and Oswald
did the same.</p>

<p>Then we had to go back to the others and
tell them. It was hard. But it was ginger-ale
and seed-cake compared to having to tell
Father, which was what it came to in the
end. For we all saw, though No&euml;l happened
to be the one to say it first, that the only
way we could really make it up to James
Johnson and his poor girl and his poor girl's
father, and the baby that was only three
weeks old, was to send them a hamper with
all the things in it&mdash;<i>real</i> things, that we had
put on the list in the revengeful hamper.
And as we had only six-and-sevenpence
among us we had to tell Father. Besides,
you feel better inside when you have. He
talked to us about it a bit, but he is a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Father and does not jaw unduly. He advanced
our pocket-money to buy a real large
Turk-and-chains. And he gave us six bottles
of port wine, because he thought that would
be better for the poor girl who had the baby
than rum or sherry or even sparkling champagne.</p>

<p>We were afraid to send the hamper by
Carter Pat. for fear they should think
it was another Avenging Take-in. And that
was one reason why we took it ourselves in
a cab. The other reason was that we wanted
to see them open the hamper, and another
was that we wanted&mdash;at least Dicky wanted&mdash;to
have it out man to man with the porter
and his wife, and tell them himself how sorry
he was.</p>

<p>So we got our gardener to find out secretly
when that porter was off duty, and when we
knew the times we went to his house at one
of them.</p>

<p>Then Dicky got out of the cab and went
in and said what he had to say. And then
we took in the hamper.</p>

<p>And the old man and his daughter and the
porter were most awfully decent to us, and
the porter's wife said, "Lor! let bygones be
bygones is what <i>I</i> say! Why, we wouldn't
never have had this handsome present but
for the other. Say no more about it, sir,
and thank you kindly, I'm sure."</p>

<p>And we have been friends with them ever
since.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>We were short of pocket-money for some
time, but Oswald does not complain, though
the Turk was Dicky's idea entirely. Yet
Oswald is just, and he owns that he helped as
much as he could in packing the Hamper of
the Avenger. Dora paid her share, too,
though she wasn't in it. The author does not
shrink from owning that this was very decent
of Dora.</p>

<h2><i>THE GOLDEN GONDOLA</i></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Albert's</span> uncle is tremendously clever, and
he writes books. I have told how he fled to
Southern shores with a lady who is rather
nice. His having to marry her was partly
our fault, but we did not mean to do it, and
we were very sorry for what we had done.
But afterwards we thought perhaps it was
all for the best, because if left alone he might
have married widows, or old German governesses,
or Murdstone aunts, like Daisy and
Denny have, instead of the fortunate lady
that we were the cause of his being married
by.</div>

<p>The wedding was just before Christmas,
and we were all there. And then they went
to Rome for a period of time that is spoken
of in books as the honeymoon. You know
that H.O., my youngest brother, tried to go
too, disguised as the contents of a dress-basket&mdash;but
was betrayed and brought back.</p>

<p>Conversation often takes place about the
things you like, and we often spoke of Albert's
uncle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>One day we had a ripping game of hide-and-seek-all-over-the-house-and-all-the-lights-out,
sometimes called devil-in-the-dark, and
never to be played except when your father
and uncle are out, because of the screams
which the strongest cannot suppress when
caught by "he" in unexpectedness and total
darkness. The girls do not like this game so
much as we do. But it is only fair for them
to play it. We have more than once played
doll's tea-parties to please them.</p>

<p>Well, when the game was over we were
panting like dogs on the hearthrug in front of
the common-room fire, and H.O. said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish Albert's uncle had been here; he
does enjoy it so."</p>

<p>Oswald has sometimes thought Albert's
uncle only played to please us. But H.O. may
be right.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they often play it in Rome,"
H.O. went on. "That post-card he sent us
with the Colly-whats-its-name-on&mdash;you know,
the round place with the arches. They could
have ripping games there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's not much fun with only two," said
Dicky.</p>

<p>"Besides," Dora said, "when people are
first married they always sit in balconies
and look at the moon, or else at each other's
eyes."</p>

<p>"They ought to know what their eyes look
like by this time," said Dicky.</p>

<p>"I believe they sit and write poetry about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
their eyes all day, and only look at each other
when they can't think of the rhymes," said
No&euml;l.</p>

<p>"I don't believe she knows how, but I'm
certain they read aloud to each other out of
the poetry books we gave them for wedding
presents," Alice said.</p>

<p>"It would be beastly ungrateful if they
didn't, especially with their backs all covered
with gold like they are," said H.O.</p>

<p>"About those books," said Oswald slowly,
now for the first time joining in what was
being said; "of course it was jolly decent of
Father to get such ripping presents for us to
give them. But I've sometimes wished we'd
given Albert's uncle a really truly present
that we'd chosen ourselves and bought with
our own chink."</p>

<p>"I wish we could have <i>done</i> something for
him," No&euml;l said; "I'd have killed a dragon for
him as soon as look at it, and Mrs. Albert's
uncle could have been the Princess, and
I would have let him have her."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dicky; "and we just gave rotten
books. But it's no use grizzling over it now.
It's all over, and he won't get married again
while she's alive."</p>

<p>This was true, for we live in England which
is a morganatic empire where more than one
wife at a time is not allowed. In the glorious
East he might have married again and again
and we could have made it all right about the
wedding present.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish he was a Turk for some things,"
said Oswald, and explained why.</p>

<p>"I don't think <i>she</i> would like it," said
Dora.</p>

<p>Oswald explained that if he was a Turk, she
would be a Turquoise (I think that is the
feminine Turk), and so would be used to lots
of wives and be lonely without them.</p>

<p>And just then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You know what they
say about talking of angels, and hearing their
wings? (There is another way of saying this,
but it is not polite, as the present author
knows.)</p>

<p>Well, just then the postman came, and of
course we rushed out, and among Father's
dull letters we found one addressed to "The
Bastables Junior." It had an Italian stamp&mdash;not
at all a rare one, and it was a poor
specimen too, and the post-mark was <i>Roma</i>.</p>

<p>That is what the Italians have got into the
habit of calling Rome. I have been told that
they put the "a" instead of the "e" because
they like to open their mouths as much as
possible in that sunny and agreeable climate.</p>

<p>The letter was jolly&mdash;it was just like hearing
him talk (I mean reading, not hearing, of
course, but reading him talk is not grammar,
and if you can't be both sensible and grammarical,
it is better to be senseless).</p>

<p>"Well, kiddies," it began, and it went on
to tell us about things he had seen, not dull
pictures and beastly old buildings, but
amusing incidents of comic nature. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Italians must be extreme Jugginses for the
kind of things he described to be of such
everyday occurring. Indeed, Oswald could
hardly believe about the soda-water label
that the Italian translated for the English
traveller so that it said, "To distrust of the
Mineral Waters too fountain-like foaming.
They spread the shape."</p>

<p>Near the end of the letter came this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You remember the chapter of 'The
Golden Gondola' that I wrote for the
<i>People's Pageant</i> just before I had the
honour to lead to the altar, &amp;c. I mean the
one that ends in the subterranean passage,
with Geraldine's hair down, and her last hope
gone, and the three villains stealing upon
her with Venetian subtlety in their hearts
and Toledo daggers (specially imported) in
their garters? I didn't care much for it myself,
you remember. I think I must have been
thinking of other things when I wrote it.
But you, I recollect, consoled me by refusing
to regard it as other than 'ripping.' 'Clinking'
was, as I recall it, Oswald's consolatory
epithet. You'll weep with me, I feel confident,
when you hear that my Editor does
not share your sentiments. He writes me
that it is not up to my usual form. He fears
that the public, &amp;c., and he trusts that in the
next chapter, &amp;c. Let us hope that the
public will, in this matter, take your views,
and not his. Oh! for a really discerning
public, just like you&mdash;you amiable critics!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Albert's new aunt is leaning over my shoulder.
I can't break her of the distracting habit.
How on earth am I ever to write another
line? Greetings to all from</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Albert's Uncle and Aunt</span>.<br />
</div>

<p>"PS.&mdash;She insists on having her name put
to this, but of course she didn't write it. I
am trying to teach her to spell."</p>

<p>"PSS.&mdash;Italian spelling, of course."</p>

<p>"And now," cried Oswald, "I see it all!"</p>

<p>The others didn't. They often don't when
Oswald does.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you see!" he patiently explained,
for he knows that it is vain to be
angry with people because they are not so
clever as&mdash;as other people. "It's the direct
aspiration of Fate. He wants it, does he?
Well, he shall have it!"</p>

<p>"What?" said everybody.</p>

<p>"We'll be it."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>" was the not very polite remark
now repeated by all.</p>

<p>"Why, his discerning public."</p>

<p>And still they all remained quite blind to
what was so clear to Oswald, the astute and
discernful.</p>

<p>"It will be much more useful than killing
dragons," Oswald went on, "especially as
there aren't any; and it will be a really truly
wedding present&mdash;just what we were wishing
we'd given him."</p>

<p>The five others now fell on Oswald and
rolled him under the table and sat on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
head so that he had to speak loudly and
plainly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">THE FIVE OTHERS</span>
</div>

<p>"All right! I'll tell you&mdash;in words of one
syllable if you like. Let go, I say!" And
when he had rolled out with the others and
the tablecloth that caught on H.O.'s boots and
the books and Dora's workbox, and the glass
of paint-water that came down with it, he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We will <i>be</i> the public. We will all write
to the editor of the <i>People's Pageant</i> and
tell him what we think about the Geraldine
chapter. Do mop up that water, Dora; it's
running all under where I'm sitting."</p>

<p>"Don't you think," said Dora, devoting her
handkerchief and Alice's in the obedient way
she does not always use, "that six letters, all
signed 'Bastable,' and all coming from the
same house, would be rather&mdash;rather&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A bit too thick? Yes," said Alice; "but
of course we'd have all different names and
addresses."</p>

<p>"We might as well do it thoroughly," said
Dicky, "and send three or four different letters
each."</p>

<p>"And have them posted in different parts
of London. Right oh!" remarked Oswald.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> shall write a piece of poetry for mine,"
said No&euml;l.</p>

<p>"They ought all to be on different kinds of
paper," said Oswald. "Let's go out and get
the paper directly after tea."</p>

<p>We did, but we could only get fifteen different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
kinds of paper and envelopes, though we
went to every shop in the village.</p>

<p>At the first shop, when we said, "Please we
want a penn'orth of paper and envelopes of
each of all the different kinds you keep," the
lady of the shop looked at us thinly over blue-rimmed
spectacles and said, "What for?"</p>

<p>And H.O. said, "To write unonymous
letters."</p>

<p>"Anonymous letters are very wrong," the
lady said, and she wouldn't sell us any paper
at all.</p>

<p>But at the other places we did not say what
it was for, and they sold it us. There were
bluey and yellowy and grey and white kinds,
and some was violetish with violets on it, and
some pink, with roses. The girls took the
florivorous ones, which Oswald thinks are
unmanly for any but girls, but you excuse
their using it. It seems natural to them to
mess about like that.</p>

<p>We wrote the fifteen letters, disguising our
handwritings as much as we could. It was
not easy. Oswald tried to write one of them
with his left hand, but the consequences were
almost totally unreadable. Besides, if any
one could have read it, they would only have
thought it was written in an asylum for the
insane, the writing was so delirious. So he
chucked it.</p>

<p>No&euml;l was only allowed to write one poem.
It began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Oh, Geraldine! Oh, Geraldine!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You are the loveliest heroine!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I never read about one before</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That made me want to write more</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Poetry. And your Venetian eyes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They must have been an awful size;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And black and blue, and like your hair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And your nose and chin were a perfect pair."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and so on for ages.</div>

<p>The other letters were all saying what a
beautiful chapter "Beneath the Doge's Home"
was, and how we liked it better than the
other chapters before, and how we hoped the
next would be like it. We found out when all
too late that H.O. had called it the "Dog's
Home." But we hoped this would pass unnoticed
among all the others. We read the
reviews of books in the old <i>Spectators</i> and
<i>Athen&aelig;ums</i>, and put in the words they say
there about other people's books. We said we
thought that chapter about Geraldine and
the garters was "subtle" and "masterly"
and "inevitable"&mdash;that it had an "old-world
charm," and was "redolent of the soil." We
said, too, that we had "read it with breathless
interest from cover to cover," and that it had
"poignant pathos and a convincing realism,"
and the "fine flower of delicate sentiment,"
besides much other rot that the author can't
remember.</p>

<p>When all the letters were done we addressed
them and stamped them and licked
them down, and then we got different people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to post them. Our under-gardener, who lives
in Greenwich, and the other under-gardener,
who lives in Lewisham, and the servants on
their evenings out, which they spend in
distant spots like Plaistow and Grove Park&mdash;each
had a letter to post. The piano-tuner
was a great catch&mdash;he lived in Highgate; and
the electric-bell man was Lambeth. So we
got rid of all the letters, and watched the post
for a reply. We watched for a week, but no
answer came.</p>

<p>You think, perhaps, that we were duffers to
watch for a reply when we had signed all the
letters with fancy names like Daisy Dolman,
Everard St. Maur, and Sir Cholmondely Marjoribanks,
and put fancy addresses on them,
like Chatsworth House, Loampit Vale, and
The Bungalow, Eaton Square. But we were
not such idiots as you think, dear reader, and
you are not so extra clever as you think,
either. We had written <i>one</i> letter (it had
the grandest <i>Spectator</i> words in it) on our
own letter-paper, with the address on the
top and the uncle's coat-of-arms outside the
envelope. Oswald's real own name was signed
to this letter, and this was the one we looked
for the answer to. See?</p>

<p>But that answer did not come. And when
three long days had passed away we all felt
most awfully stale about it. Knowing the
great good we had done for Albert's uncle
made our interior feelings very little better,
if at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>And on the fourth day Oswald spoke up
and said what was in everybody's inside
heart. He said&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is futile rot. I vote we write and ask
that editor why he doesn't answer letters."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't answer that one any more
than he did the other," said No&euml;l. "Why
should he? He knows you can't do anything
to him for not."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't we go and ask him?" H.O.
said. "He couldn't not answer us if we was
all there, staring him in the face."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose he'd see you," said Dora;
"and it's 'were,' not 'was.'"</p>

<p>"The other editor did when I got the guinea
for my beautiful poems," No&euml;l reminded us.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the thoughtful Oswald; "but
then it doesn't matter how young you are
when you're just a poetry-seller. But we're
the discerning public now, and he'd think we
ought to be grown up. I say, Dora, suppose
you rigged yourself up in old Blakie's things.
You'd look quite twenty or thirty."</p>

<p>Dora looked frightened, and said she
thought we'd better not.</p>

<p>But Alice said, "Well, I will, then. I don't
care. I'm as tall as Dora. But I won't go
alone. Oswald, you'll have to dress up old
and come too. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Its'">It's</ins> not much to do for
Albert's uncle's sake."</p>

<p>"You know you'll enjoy it," said Dora, and
she may have wished that she did not so often
think that we had better not. However, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
dye was now cast, and the remainder of this
adventure was doomed to be coloured by the
dye we now prepared. (This is an allegory.
It means we had burned our boats. And that
is another.)</p>

<p>We decided to do the deed next day, and
during the evening Dicky and Oswald went
out and bought a grey beard and moustache,
which was the only thing we could think of
to disguise the manly and youthful form of
the bold Oswald into the mature shape of a
grown-up and discerning public character.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the girls made tiptoe and
brigand-like excursions into Miss Blake's
room (she is the housekeeper) and got
several things. Among others, a sort of
undecided thing like part of a wig, which
Miss Blake wears on Sundays. Jane, our
housemaid, says it is called a "transformation,"
and that duchesses wear them.</p>

<p>We had to be very secret about the dressing-up
that night, and to put Blakie's things all
back when they had been tried on.</p>

<p>Dora did Alice's hair. She twisted up what
little hair Alice has got by natural means,
and tied on a long tail of hair that was Miss
Blake's too. Then she twisted that up, bun-like,
with many hairpins. Then the wiglet,
or transformation, was plastered over the
front part, and Miss Blake's Sunday hat,
which is of a very brisk character, with half
a blue bird in it, was placed on top of
everything. There were several petticoats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
used, and a brown dress and some stockings
and hankies to stuff it out where it was too
big. A black jacket and crimson tie completed
the picture. We thought Alice would
do.</p>

<p>Then Oswald went out of the room and
secretly assumed his dark disguise. But
when he came in with the beard on, and a hat
of Father's, the others were not struck with
admiration and respect, like he meant them
to be. They rolled about, roaring with
laughter, and when he crept into Miss
Blake's room and turned up the gas a bit,
and looked in her long glass, he owned that
they were right and that it was no go. He
is tall for his age, but that beard made him
look like some horrible dwarf; and his hair
being so short added to everything. Any
idiot could have seen that the beard had not
originally flourished where it now was, but
had been transplanted from some other place
of growth.</p>

<p>And when he laughed, which now became
necessary, he really did look most awful. He
has read of beards wagging, but he never saw
it before.</p>

<p>While he was looking at himself the girls
had thought of a new idea.</p>

<p>But Oswald had an inside presentiment
that made it some time before he could even
consent to listen to it. But at last, when the
others reminded him that it was a noble act,
and for the good of Albert's uncle, he let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
them explain the horrid scheme in all its
lurid parts.</p>

<p>It was this: That Oswald should consent to
be disguised in women's raiments and go
with Alice to see the Editor.</p>

<p>No man ever wants to be a woman, and it
was a bitter thing for Oswald's pride, but at
last he consented. He is glad he is not a girl.
You have no idea what it is like to wear
petticoats, especially long ones. I wonder
that ladies continue to endure their miserable
existences. The top parts of the clothes, too,
seemed to be too tight and too loose in
the wrong places. Oswald's head, also, was
terribly in the way. He had no wandering
hairs to fasten transformations on to, even if
Miss Blake had had another one, which was
not the case. But the girls remembered a
governess they had once witnessed whose
hair was brief as any boy's, so they put a
large hat, with a very tight elastic behind, on
to Oswald's head, just as it was, and then
with a tickly, pussyish, featherish thing round
his neck, hanging wobblily down in long ends,
he looked more young-lady-like than he will
ever feel.</p>

<p>Some courage was needed for the start next
day. Things look so different in the daylight.</p>

<p>"Remember Lord Nithsdale coming out of
the Tower," said Alice. "Think of the great
cause and be brave," and she tied his neck up.</p>

<p>"I'm brave all right," said Oswald, "only
I do feel such an ass."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"I feel rather an ape myself," Alice owned,
"but I've got three-penn'orth of peppermints
to inspire us with bravery. It is called Dutch
courage, I believe."</p>

<p>Owing to our telling Jane we managed to
get out unseen by Blakie.</p>

<p>All the others would come, too, in their
natural appearance, except that we made
them wash their hands and faces. We happened
to be flush of chink, so we let them
come.</p>

<p>"But if you do," Oswald said, "you must
surround us in a hollow square of four."</p>

<p>So they did. And we got down to the
station all right. But in the train there were
two ladies who stared, and porters and people
like that came round the window far more
than there could be any need for. Oswald's
boots must have shown as he got in. He had
forgotten to borrow a pair of Jane's, as he
had meant to, and the ones he had on were
his largest. His ears got hotter and hotter,
and it got more and more difficult to manage
his feet and hands. He failed to suck any
courage, of any nation, from the peppermints.</p>


<p>Owing to the state Oswald's ears were now
in, we agreed to take a cab at Cannon Street.
We all crammed in somehow, but Oswald saw
the driver wink as he put his boot on the step,
and the porter who was opening the cab door
winked back, and I am sorry to say Oswald
forgot that he was a high-born lady, and he
told the porter that he had better jolly well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
stow his cheek. Then several bystanders
began to try and be funny, and Oswald knew
exactly what particular sort of fool he was
being.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 481px;">

<span class="caption">OSWALD SAW THE DRIVER WINK AS HE PUT HIS BOOT ON THE STEP, AND THE PORTER WHO WAS OPENING THE CAB DOOR WINKED BACK.</span>
</div>

<p>But he bravely silenced the fierce warnings
of his ears, and when we got to the Editor's
address we sent Dick up with a large card
that we had written on,</p>

<div class='center'>
"<span class="smcap">Miss Daisy Dolman</span><br />
and<br />
<span class="smcap">The Right Honourable Miss<br />
Etheltruda Bustler</span>.<br />
On urgent business."<br />
</div>

<p>and Oswald kept himself and Alice concealed
in the cab till the return of the messenger.</p>

<p>"All right; you're to go up," Dicky came
back and said; "but the boy grinned who told
me so. You'd better be jolly careful."</p>

<p>We bolted like rabbits across the pavement
and up the Editor's stairs.</p>

<p>He was very polite. He asked us to sit
down, and Oswald did. But first he tumbled
over the front of his dress because it would
get under his boots, and he was afraid to hold
it up, not having practised doing this.</p>

<p>"I think I have had letters from you?" said
the Editor.</p>


<p>Alice, who looked terrible with the transformation
leaning right-ear-ward, said yes,
and that we had come to say what a fine, bold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
conception we thought the Doge's chapter
was. This was what we had settled to say,
but she needn't have burst out with it like
that. I suppose she forgot herself. Oswald,
in the agitation of his clothes, could say
nothing. The elastic of the hat seemed to be
very slowly slipping up the back of his head,
and he knew that, if it once passed the bump
that backs of heads are made with, the hat
would spring from his head like an arrow
from a bow. And all would be frustrated.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 543px;">
<img src="images/gs25.png" width="543" height="400" alt="HE LOOKED AT OSWALD&#39;S BOOTS." title="HE LOOKED AT OSWALD&#39;S BOOTS." />
<span class="caption">HE LOOKED AT OSWALD&#39;S BOOTS.</span>
</div>

<p>"Yes," said the Editor; "that chapter seems
to have had a great success&mdash;a wonderful
success. I had no fewer than sixteen letters
about it, all praising it in unmeasured terms."
He looked at Oswald's boots, which Oswald
had neglected to cover over with his petticoats.
He now did this.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a nice story, you know," said Alice
timidly.</p>

<p>"So it seems," the gentleman went on.
"Fourteen of the sixteen letters bear the
Blackheath postmark. The enthusiasm for
the chapter would seem to be mainly local."</p>

<p>Oswald would not look at Alice. He could
not trust himself, with her looking like she
did. He knew at once that only the piano-tuner
and the electric bell man had been
faithful to their trust. The others had all
posted their letters in the pillar-box just outside
our gate. They wanted to get rid of
them as quickly as they could, I suppose.
Selfishness is a vile quality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>The author cannot deny that Oswald now
wished he hadn't. The elastic was certainly
moving, slowly, but too surely. Oswald tried
to check its career by swelling out the bump
on the back of his head, but he could not
think of the right way to do this.</p>

<p>"I am very pleased to see you," the Editor
went on slowly, and there was something
about the way he spoke that made Oswald
think of a cat playing with a mouse. "Perhaps
you can tell me. Are there many
spiritualists in Blackheath? Many clairvoyants?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" said Alice, forgetting that that is
not the way to behave.</p>

<p>"People who foretell the future?" he
said.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Alice. "Why?"</p>

<p>His eye twinkled. Oswald saw he had
wanted her to ask this.</p>

<p>"Because," said the Editor, more slowly
than ever, "I think there must be. How
otherwise can we account for that chapter
about the 'Doge's Home' being read and
admired by sixteen different people before it
is even printed. That chapter has not been
printed, it has not been published; it will not
be published till the May number of the
<i>People's Pageant</i>. Yet in Blackheath sixteen
people already appreciate its subtlety and its
realism and all the rest of it. How do you
account for this, Miss Daisy Dolman?"</p>

<p>"I am the Right Honourable Etheltruda,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
said Alice. "At least&mdash;oh, it's no use going
on. We are not what we seem."</p>

<p>"Oddly enough, I inferred that at the very
beginning of our interview," said the Editor.</p>

<p>Then the elastic finished slipping up Oswald's
head at the back, and the hat leapt from his
head exactly as he had known it would. He
fielded it deftly, however, and it did not touch
the ground.</p>

<p>"Concealment," said Oswald, "is at an
end."</p>

<p>"So it appears," said the Editor. "Well,
I hope next time the author of the 'Golden
Gondola' will choose his instruments more
carefully."</p>

<p>"He didn't! We aren't!" cried Alice, and
she instantly told the Editor everything.</p>

<p>Concealment being at an end, Oswald was
able to get at his trousers pocket&mdash;it did not
matter now how many boots he showed&mdash;and
to get out Albert's uncle's letter.</p>

<p>Alice was quite eloquent, especially when
the Editor had made her take off the hat
with the blue bird, and the transformation
and the tail, so that he could see what she
really looked like. He was quite decent
when he really understood how Albert's
uncle's threatened marriage must have upset
his brain while he was writing that
chapter, and pondering on the dark future.</p>

<p>He began to laugh then, and kept it up till
the hour of parting.</p>

<p>He advised Alice not to put on the transformation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and the tail again to go home in,
and she didn't.</p>

<p>Then he said to me: "Are you in a finished
state under Miss Daisy Dolman?" and when
Oswald said, "Yes," the Editor helped him to
take off all the womanly accoutrements, and
to do them up in brown paper. And he lent
him a cap to go home in.</p>

<p>I never saw a man laugh more. He is an
excellent sort.</p>

<p>But no slow passage of years, however
many, can ever weaken Oswald's memory
of what those petticoats were like to walk
in, and how ripping it was to get out of them,
and have your own natural legs again.</p>

<p>We parted from that Editor without a
strain on anybody's character.</p>

<p>He must have written to Albert's uncle,
and told him all, for we got a letter next
week. It said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Kiddies</span>,&mdash;Art cannot be forced.
Nor can Fame. May I beg you for the
future to confine your exertions to blowing
my trumpet&mdash;or Fame's&mdash;with your natural
voices? Editors may be led, but they won't
be druv. The Right Honourable Miss Etheltruda
Bustler seems to have aroused a deep
pity for me in my Editor's heart. Let that
suffice. And for the future permit me, as
firmly as affectionately, to reiterate the
assurance and the advice which I have so
often breathed in your long young ears, '<i>I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
am not ungrateful; but I do wish you would
mind your own business.</i>'"</p></div>

<p>"That's just because we were found out,"
said Alice. "If we'd succeeded he'd have
been sitting on the top of the pinnacle of
Fame, and he would have owed it all to us.
That would have been making him something
like a wedding present."</p>

<p>What we had really done was to make
something very like&mdash;&mdash;but the author is

<h2><i>THE FLYING LODGER</i></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Father</span> knows a man called Eustace Sandal.
I do not know how to express his inside soul,
but I have heard Father say he means well.
He is a vegetarian and a Primitive Social
Something, and an all-wooler, and things like
that, and he is really as good as he can stick,
only most awfully dull. I believe he eats
bread and milk from choice. Well, he has
great magnificent dreams about all the things
you can do for other people, and he wants to
distill cultivatedness into the sort of people
who live in Model Workmen's Dwellings, and
teach them to live up to better things. This
is what he says. So he gives concerts in
Camberwell, and places like that, and curates
come from far and near, to sing about Bold
Bandaleros and the Song of the Bow, and
people who have escaped being curates give
comic recitings, and he is sure that it does
every one good, and "gives them glimpses of
the Life Beautiful." He said that. Oswald
heard him with his own trustworthy ears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Anyway the people enjoy the concerts no
end, and that's the great thing.</div>

<p>Well, he came one night, with a lot of
tickets he wanted to sell, and Father bought
some for the servants, and Dora happened to
go in to get the gum for a kite we were
making, and Mr. Sandal said, "Well, my little
maiden, would you not like to come on Thursday
evening, and share in the task of raising
our poor brothers and sisters to the higher
levels of culture?" So of course Dora said
she would, very much. Then he explained
about the concert, calling her "My little one,"
and "dear child," which Alice never would
have borne, but Dora is not of a sensitive
nature, and hardly minds what she is called,
so long as it is not names, which she does not
deem "dear child" and cetera to be, though
Oswald would.</p>

<p>Dora was quite excited about it, and the
stranger so worked upon her feelings that she
accepted the deep responsibility of selling
tickets, and for a week there was no bearing
her. I believe she did sell nine, to people in
Lewisham and New Cross who knew no
better. And Father bought tickets for all of
us, and when the eventful evening dawned we
went to Camberwell by train and tram <i>vi&acirc;</i>
Miss Blake (that means we shouldn't have
been allowed to go without her).</p>

<p>The tram ride was rather jolly, but when
we got out and walked we felt like "Alone in
London," or "Jessica's First Prayer," because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Camberwell is a devastating region that makes
you think of rickety attics with the wind
whistling through them, or miserable cellars
where forsaken children do wonders by pawning
their relations' clothes and looking after
the baby. It was a dampish night, and we
walked on greasy mud. And as we walked
along Alice kicked against something on the
pavement, and it chinked, and when she
picked it up it was five bob rolled up in newspaper.</p>

<p>"I expect it's somebody's little all," said
Alice, "and the cup was dashed from their
lips just when they were going to joyfully
spend it. We ought to give it to the police."</p>

<p>But Miss Blake said no, and that we were
late already, so we went on, and Alice held
the packet in her muff throughout the concert
which ensued. I will not tell you anything
about the concert except that it was quite
fairly jolly&mdash;you must have been to these Self-Raising
Concerts in the course of your young
lives.</p>

<p>When it was over we reasoned with Miss
Blake, and she let us go through the light
blue paper door beside the stage and find Mr.
Sandal. We thought he might happen to
hear who had lost the five bob, and return it
to its sorrowing family. He was in a great
hurry, but he took the chink and said he'd let
us know if anything happened. Then we
went home very cheerful, singing bits of the
comic songs a bishop's son had done in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
concert, and little thinking what we were
taking home with us.</p>

<p>It was only a few days after this, or perhaps
a week, that we all began to be rather
cross. Alice, usually as near a brick as a girl
can go, was the worst of the lot, and if you
said what you thought of her she instantly
began to snivel. And we all had awful colds,
and our handkerchiefs gave out, and then our
heads ached. Oswald's head was particularly
hot, I remember, and he wanted to rest it on
the backs of chairs or on tables&mdash;or anything
steady.</p>

<p>But why prolong the painful narrative?
What we had brought home from Camberwell
was the measles, and as soon as the grown-ups
recognised the Grim Intruder for the fell
disease it is we all went to bed, and there was
an end of active adventure for some time.</p>

<p>Of course, when you begin to get better
there are grapes and other luxuries not of
everyday occurrences, but while you're sniffling
and fevering in bed, as red as a lobster
and blazing hot, you are inclined to think it is
a heavy price to pay for any concert, however
raising.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandal came to see Father the very day
we all marched Bedward. He had found the
owner of the five shillings. It was a doctor's
fee, about to be paid by the parent of a
thoroughly measly family. And if we had
taken it to the police at once Alice would not
have held it in her hand all through the concert&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
I will not blame Blakie. She was a
jolly good nurse, and read aloud to us with
unfatiguable industry while we were getting
better.</p>

<p>Our having fallen victims to this disgusting
complaint ended in our being sent to the seaside.
Father could not take us himself, so we
went to stay with a sister of Mr. Sandal's.
She was like him, only more so in every way.</p>

<p>The journey was very joyous. Father saw
us off at Cannon Street, and we had a carriage
to ourselves all the way, and we passed the
station where Oswald would not like to be a
porter. Rude boys at this station put their
heads out of the window and shout, "Who's
a duffer?" and things like that, and the porters
<i>have</i> to shout "I am!" because Higham is the
name of the station, and porters have seldom
any H's with which to protect themselves
from this cruel joke.</p>

<p>It was a glorious moment when the train
swooped out of a tunnel and we looked over
the downs and saw the grey-blue line that
was the sea. We had not seen the sea since
before Mother died. I believe we older ones
all thought of that, and it made us quieter
than the younger ones were. I do not want
to forget anything, but it makes you feel
empty and stupid when you remember some
things.</p>

<p>There was a good drive in a waggonette
after we got to our station. There were
primroses under some of the hedges, and lots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of dog-violets. And at last we got to Miss
Sandal's house. It is before you come to the
village, and it is a little square white house.
There is a big old windmill at the back of it.
It is not used any more for grinding corn, but
fishermen keep their nets in it.</p>

<p>Miss Sandal came out of the green gate to
meet us. She had a soft, drab dress and a
long thin neck, and her hair was drab too,
and it was screwed up tight.</p>

<p>She said, "Welcome, one and all!" in a
kind voice, but it was too much like Mr.
Sandal's for me. And we went in. She
showed us the sitting-rooms, and the rooms
where we were to sleep, and then she left us
to wash our hands and faces. When we were
alone we burst open the doors of our rooms
with one consent, and met on the landing with
a rush like the great rivers of America.</p>

<p>"<i>Well!</i>" said Oswald, and the others said
the same.</p>

<p>"Of all the rummy cribs!" remarked Dicky.</p>

<p>"It's like a workhouse or a hospital," said
Dora. "I think I like it."</p>

<p>"It makes me think of bald-headed gentlemen,"
said H.O., "it is so bare."</p>

<p>It was. All the walls were white plaster,
the furniture was white deal&mdash;what there was
of it, which was precious little. There were
no carpets&mdash;only white matting. And there
was not a single ornament in a single room!
There was a clock on the dining-room mantel-piece,
but that could not be counted as an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
ornament because of the useful side of its
character. There were only about six pictures&mdash;all
of a brownish colour. One was the blind
girl sitting on an orange with a broken fiddle.
It is called Hope.</p>

<p>When we were clean Miss Sandal gave us
tea. As we sat down she said, "The motto
of our little household is 'Plain living and
high thinking.'"</p>

<p>And some of us feared for an instant that
this might mean not enough to eat. But
fortunately this was not the case. There was
plenty, but all of a milky, bunny, fruity,
vegetable sort. We soon got used to it, and
liked it all right.</p>

<p>Miss Sandal was very kind. She offered to
read aloud to us after tea, and, exchanging
glances of despair, some of us said that we
should like it very much.</p>

<p>It was Oswald who found the manly courage
to say very politely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Would it be all the same to you if we
went and looked at the sea first? Because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And she said, "Not at all," adding something
about "Nature, the dear old nurse, taking
somebody on her knee," and let us go.</p>

<p>We asked her which way, and we tore up
the road and through the village and on to
the sea-wall, and then with six joyous bounds
we leaped down on to the sand.</p>

<p>The author will not bother you with a
description of the mighty billows of ocean,
which you must have read about, if not seen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'But'">but</ins> he will just say what perhaps you are not
aware of&mdash;that seagulls eat clams and mussels
and cockles, and crack the shells with their
beaks. The author has seen this done.</p>

<p>You also know, I suppose, that you can dig
in the sand (if you have a spade) and make
sand castles, and stay in them till the tide
washes you out.</p>

<p>I will say no more, except that when we
gazed upon the sea and the sand we felt we
did not care tuppence how highly Miss Sandal
might think of us or how plainly she might
make us live, so long as we had got the briny
deep to go down to.</p>

<p>It was too early in the year and too late in
the day to bathe, but we paddled, which
comes to much the same thing, and you
almost always have to change everything
afterwards.</p>

<p>When it got dark we had to go back to the
White House, and there was supper, and then
we found that Miss Sandal did not keep a
servant, so of course we offered to help wash
up. H.O. only broke two plates.</p>

<p>Nothing worth telling about happened till
we had been there over a week, and had got
to know the coastguards and a lot of the
village people quite well. I do like coastguards.
They seem to know everything you want
to hear about. Miss Sandal used to read
to us out of poetry books, and about a chap
called Thoreau, who could tickle fish, and they
liked it, and let him. She was kind, but rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
like her house&mdash;there was something bare and
bald about her inside mind, I believe. She
was very, very calm, and said that people who
lost their tempers were not living the higher
life. But one day a telegram came, and then
she was not calm at all. She got quite like
other people, and quite shoved H.O. for
getting in her way when she was looking
for her purse to pay for the answer to the
telegram.</p>

<p>Then she said to Dora&mdash;and she was pale
and her eyes red, just like people who live the
lower or ordinary life&mdash;"My dears, it's dreadful!
My poor brother! He's had a fall. I must go
to him at <i>once</i>." And she sent Oswald to order
the fly from the Old Ship Hotel, and the girls
to see if Mrs. Beale would come and take care
of us while she was away. Then she kissed
us all and went off very unhappy. We heard
afterwards that poor, worthy Mr. Sandal had
climbed a scaffolding to give a workman a
tract about drink, and he didn't know the
proper part of the scaffolding to stand on (the
workman did, of course) so he fetched down
half a dozen planks and the workman, and if
a dust-cart hadn't happened to be passing just
under so that they fell into it their lives
would not have been spared. As it was Mr.
Sandal broke his arm and his head. The
workman escaped unscathed but furious.
The workman was a teetotaler.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beale came, and the first thing she did
was to buy a leg of mutton and cook it. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
was the first meat we had had since arriving
at Lymchurch.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/gs26.png" width="380" height="500" alt="HE FETCHED DOWN HALF A DOZEN PLANKS AND THE WORKMAN." title="HE FETCHED DOWN HALF A DOZEN PLANKS AND THE WORKMAN." />
<span class="caption">HE FETCHED DOWN HALF A DOZEN PLANKS AND THE WORKMAN.</span>
</div>

<p>"I 'spect she can't afford good butcher's
meat," said Mrs. Beale; "but your pa, I expect
he pays for you, and I lay he'd like you to
have your fill of something as'll lay acrost
your chesties." So she made a Yorkshire
pudding as well. It was good.</p>

<p>After dinner we sat on the sea-wall, feeling
more like after dinner than we had felt for
days, and Dora said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poor Miss Sandal! I never thought about
her being hard-up, somehow. I wish we could
do something to help her."</p>

<p>"We might go out street-singing," No&euml;l said.
But that was no good, because there is only
one street in the village, and the people there
are much too poor for one to be able to ask
them for anything. And all round it is fields
with only sheep, who have nothing to give
except their wool, and when it comes to
taking that, they are never asked.</p>

<p>Dora thought we might get Father to give
her money, but Oswald knew this would never
do.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a thought struck some one&mdash;I
will not say who&mdash;and that some one
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"She ought to let lodgings, like all the other
people do in Lymchurch."</p>

<p>That was the beginning of it. The end&mdash;for
that day&mdash;was our getting the top of a
cardboard box and printing on it the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
lines in as many different coloured chalks as
we happened to have with us.</p>

<div class='center'>
LODGINGS TO LET.<br />
<br />
ENQUIRE INSIDE.<br />
</div>

<p>We ruled spaces for the letters to go in, and
did it very neatly. When we went to bed we
stuck it in our bedroom window with stamp-paper.</p>

<p>In the morning when Oswald drew up his
blind there was quite a crowd of kids looking
at the card. Mrs. Beale came out and shoo-ed
them away as if they were hens. And we did
not have to explain the card to her at all.
She never said anything about it. I never
knew such a woman as Mrs. Beale for minding
her own business. She said afterwards she
supposed Miss Sandal had told us to put up
the card.</p>

<p>Well, two or three days went by, and
nothing happened, only we had a letter
from Miss Sandal, telling us how the poor
sufferer was groaning, and one from Father
telling us to be good children, and not get
into scrapes. And people who drove by used
to look at the card and laugh.</p>

<p>And then one day a carriage came driving
up with a gentleman in it, and he saw the
rainbow beauty of our chalked card, and he
got out and came up the path. He had a
pale face, and white hair and very bright eyes
that moved about quickly like a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'birds'">bird's</ins>, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
was dressed in a quite new tweed suit that
did not fit him very well.</p>

<p>Dora and Alice answered the door before
any one had time to knock, and the author
has reason to believe their hearts were beating
wildly.</p>

<p>"How much?" said the gentleman shortly.</p>

<p>Alice and Dora were so surprised by his
suddenness that they could only reply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just so," said the gentleman briskly as
Oswald stepped modestly forward and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Won't you come inside?"</p>

<p>"The very thing," said he, and came in.</p>

<p>We showed him into the dining-room and
asked him to excuse us a minute, and then
held a breathless council outside the door.</p>

<p>"It depends how many rooms he wants,"
said Dora.</p>

<p>"Let's say so much a room," said Dicky,
"and extra if he wants Mrs. Beale to wait on
him."</p>

<p>So we decided to do this. We thought a
pound a room seemed fair.</p>

<p>And we went back.</p>

<p>"How many rooms do you want?" Oswald
asked.</p>

<p>"All the room there is," said the gentleman.</p>

<p>"They are a pound each," said Oswald, "and
extra for Mrs. Beale."</p>

<p>"How much altogether?"</p>

<p>Oswald thought a minute and then said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
"Nine rooms is nine pounds, and two pounds
a week for Mrs. Beale, because she is a widow."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 305px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;HOW MUCH?&quot; SAID THE GENTLEMAN SHORTLY.</span>
</div>

<p>"Done!" said the gentleman. "I'll go and
fetch my portmanteaus."</p>

<p>He bounced up and out and got into his
carriage and drove away. It was not till he
was finally gone quite beyond recall that Alice
suddenly said&mdash;</p>

<p>"But if he has all the rooms where are <i>we</i>
to sleep?"</p>

<p>"He must be awfully rich," said H.O.,
"wanting all those rooms."</p>

<p>"Well, he can't sleep in more than one at
once," said Dicky, "however rich he is. We
might wait till he was bedded down and then
sleep in the rooms he didn't want."</p>

<p>But Oswald was firm. He knew that if the
man paid for the rooms he must have them to
himself.</p>

<p>"He won't sleep in the kitchen," said Dora;
"couldn't we sleep there?"</p>

<p>But we all said we couldn't and wouldn't.</p>

<p>Then Alice suddenly said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know! The Mill. There are heaps and
heaps of fishing-nets there, and we could each
take a blanket like Indians and creep over
under cover of the night after the Beale has
gone, and get back before she comes in the
morning."</p>

<p>It seemed a sporting thing to do, and we
agreed. Only Dora said she thought it would
be draughty.</p>

<p>Of course we went over to the Mill at once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to lay our plans and prepare for the silent
watches of the night.</p>

<p>There are three stories to a windmill,
besides the ground-floor. The first floor is
pretty empty; the next is nearly full of millstones
and machinery, and the one above is
where the corn runs down from on to the
millstones.</p>

<p>We settled to let the girls have the first
floor, which was covered with heaps of nets,
and we would pig in with the millstones on
the floor above.</p>

<p>We had just secretly got out the last of the
six blankets from the house and got it into
the Mill disguised in a clothes-basket, when
we heard wheels, and there was the gentleman
back again. He had only got one portmanteau
after all, and that was a very little one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beale was bobbing at him in the doorway
when we got up. Of course we had told
her he had rented rooms, but we had not said
how many, for fear she should ask where we
were going to sleep, and we had a feeling that
but few grown-ups would like our sleeping in
a mill, however much we were living the
higher life by sacrificing ourselves to get
money for Miss Sandal.</p>

<p>The gentleman ordered sheep's-head and
trotters for dinner, and when he found he
could not have that he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gammon and spinach!"</p>

<p>But there was not any spinach in the village,
so he had to fall back on eggs and bacon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Mrs. Beale cooked it, and when he had fallen
back on it she washed up and went home.
And we were left. We could hear the gentleman
singing to himself, something about woulding
he was a bird that he might fly to thee.</p>

<p>Then we got the lanterns that you take
when you go "up street" on a dark night,
and we crept over to the Mill. It was much
darker than we expected.</p>

<p>We decided to keep our clothes on, partly
for warmness and partly in case of any sudden
alarm or the fishermen wanting their nets in
the middle of the night, which sometimes
happens if the tide is favourable.</p>

<p>We let the girls keep the lantern, and we
went up with a bit of candle Dicky had saved,
and tried to get comfortable among the millstones
and machinery, but it was not easy,
and Oswald, for one, was not sorry when he
heard the voice of Dora calling in trembling
tones from the floor below.</p>

<p>"Oswald! Dicky!" said the voice, "I wish
one of you would come down a sec."</p>

<p>Oswald flew to the assistance of his distressed
sister.</p>

<p>"It's only that we're a little bit uncomfortable,"
she whispered. "I didn't want to yell
it out because of No&euml;l and H.O. I don't want
to frighten them, but I can't help feeling that
if anything popped out of the dark at us I
should die. Can't you all come down here?
The nets are quite comfortable, and I do wish
you would."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Alice said she was not frightened, but
suppose there were rats, which are said to
infest old buildings, especially mills?</p>

<p>So we consented to come down, and we told
No&euml;l and H.O. to come down because it was
more comfy, and it is easier to settle yourself
for the night among fishing-nets than among
machinery. There <i>was</i> a rustling now and
then among the heap of broken chairs and
jack-planes and baskets and spades and hoes
and bits of the spars of ships at the far end
of our sleeping apartment, but Dicky and
Oswald resolutely said it was the wind or
else jackdaws making their nests, though,
of course, they knew this is not done at night.</p>

<p>Sleeping in a mill was not nearly the fun
we had thought it would be&mdash;somehow. For
one thing, it was horrid not having a pillow,
and the fishing-nets were so stiff you could
not bunch them up properly to make one.
And unless you have been born and bred a
Red Indian you do not know how to manage
your blanket so as to make it keep out the
draughts. And when we had put out the
light Oswald more than once felt as though
earwigs and spiders were walking on his face
in the dark, but when we struck a match
there was nothing there.</p>

<p>And empty mills do creak and rustle and
move about in a very odd way. Oswald was
not afraid, but he did think we might as well
have slept in the kitchen, because the gentleman
could not have wanted to use that when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
he was asleep. You see, we thought then
that he would sleep all night like other
people.</p>

<p>We got to sleep at last, and in the night
the girls edged up to their bold brothers, so
that when the morning sun "shone in bars of
dusty gold through the chinks of the aged
edifice" and woke us up we were all lying in
a snuggly heap like a litter of puppies.</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>am</i> so stiff!" said Alice, stretching.
"I never slept in my clothes before. It makes
me feel as if I had been starched and ironed
like a boy's collar."</p>

<p>We all felt pretty much the same. And our
faces were tired too, and stiff, which was
rum, and the author cannot account for it,
unless it really was spiders that walked on us.
I believe the ancient Greeks considered them
to be venomous, and perhaps that's how their
venom influences their victims.</p>

<p>"I think mills are merely beastly," remarked
H.O. when we had woke him up. "You can't
wash yourself or brush your hair or anything."</p>

<p>"You aren't always so jolly particular about
your hair," said Dicky.</p>

<p>"Don't be so disagreeable," said Dora.</p>

<p>And Dicky rejoined, "Disagreeable yourself!"</p>

<p>There is certainly something about sleeping
in your clothes that makes you feel not so
kind and polite as usual. I expect this is why
tramps are so fierce and knock people down
in lonely roads and kick them. Oswald knows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
he felt just like kicking any one if they had
happened to cheek him the least little bit.
But by a fortunate accident nobody did.</p>

<p>The author believes there is a picture called
"Hopeless Dawn." We felt exactly like that.
Nothing seemed the least bit of good.</p>

<p>It was a pitiful band with hands and faces
dirtier than any one would believe who had
not slept in a mill or witnessed others who
had done so, that crossed the wet, green grass
between the Mill and the white house.</p>

<p>"I shan't ever put morning dew into my
poetry again," No&euml;l said; "it is not nearly so
poetical as people make out, and it is as cold
as ice, right through your boots."</p>

<p>We felt rather better when we had had a
good splash in the brick-paved back kitchen
that Miss Sandal calls the bath-room. And
Alice made a fire and boiled a kettle and we
had some tea and eggs. Then we looked at
the clock and it was half-past five. So we
hastened to get into another part of the
house before Mrs. Beale came.</p>

<p>"I wish we'd tried to live the higher life
some less beastly way," said Dicky as we went
along the passage.</p>

<p>"Living the higher life always hurts at the
beginning," Alice said. "I expect it's like new
boots, only when you've got used to it you're
glad you bore it at first. Let's listen at the
doors till we find out where he isn't sleeping."</p>

<p>So we listened at all the bedroom doors, but
not a snore was heard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps he was a burglar," said H.O.,
"and only pretended to want lodgings so as
to get in and bone all the valuables."</p>

<p>"There aren't any valuables," said No&euml;l, and
this was quite true, for Miss Sandal had no
silver or jewellery except a brooch of pewter,
and the very teaspoons were of wood&mdash;very
hard to keep clean and having to be scraped.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he sleeps without snoring," said
Oswald, "some people do."</p>

<p>"Not old gentlemen," said No&euml;l; "think of
our Indian uncle&mdash;H.O. used to think it was
bears at first."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he rises with the lark," said Alice,
"and is wondering why brekker isn't ready."</p>

<p>So then we listened at the sitting-room
doors, and through the keyhole of the parlour
we heard a noise of some one moving, and
then in a soft whistle the tune of the "Would
I were a bird" song.</p>

<p>So then we went into the dining-room to
sit down. But when we opened the door we
almost fell in a heap on the matting, and no
one had breath for a word&mdash;not even for
"Krikey," which was what we all thought.</p>

<p>I have read of people who could not believe
their eyes; and I have always thought it such
rot of them, but now, as the author gazed on
the scene, he really could not be quite sure
that he was not in a dream, and that the
gentleman and the night in the Mill weren't
dreams too.</p>

<p>"Pull back the curtains," Alice said, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
did. I wish I could make the reader feel as
astonished as we did.</p>

<p>The last time we had seen the room the
walls had been bare and white. Now they
were covered with the most splendid drawings
you can think of, all done in coloured chalk&mdash;I
don't mean mixed up, like we do with our
chalks&mdash;but one picture was done in green,
and another in brown, and another in red, and
so on. And the chalk must have been of
some fat radiant kind quite unknown to us,
for some of the lines were over an inch thick.</p>

<p>"How perfectly <i>lovely!</i>" Alice said; "he
must have sat up all night to do it. He <i>is</i>
good. I expect he's trying to live the higher
life, too&mdash;just going about doing secretly, and
spending his time making other people's
houses pretty."</p>

<p>"I wonder what he'd have done if the room
had had a large pattern of brown roses on it,
like Mrs. Beale's," said No&euml;l. "I say, <i>look</i> at
that angel! Isn't it poetical? It makes me
feel I must write something about it."</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> a good angel&mdash;all drawn in grey, that
was&mdash;with very wide wings going right across
the room, and a whole bundle of lilies in his
arms. Then there were seagulls and ravens,
and butterflies, and ballet girls with butterflies'
wings, and a man with artificial wings being
fastened on, and you could see he was just going
to jump off a rock. And there were fairies,
and bats, and flying-foxes, and flying-fish.
And one glorious winged horse done in red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
chalk&mdash;and his wings went from one side of
the room to the other, and crossed the angel's.
There were dozens and dozens of birds&mdash;all
done in just a few lines&mdash;but exactly right.
You couldn't make any mistake about what
anything was meant for.</p>

<p>And all the things, whatever they were,
had wings to them. How Oswald wishes that
those pictures had been done in his house!</p>

<p>While we stood gazing, the door of the
other room opened, and the gentleman stood
before us, more covered with different-coloured
chalks than I should have thought
he could have got, even with all those drawings,
and he had a thing made of wire and
paper in his hand, and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to fly?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said every one.</p>

<p>"Well then," he said, "I've got a nice little
flying-machine here. I'll fit it on to one of
you, and then you jump out of the attic
window. You don't know what it's like to
fly."</p>

<p>We said we would rather not.</p>

<p>"But I insist," said the gentleman. "I have
your real interest at heart, my children&mdash;I
can't allow you in your ignorance to reject
the chance of a lifetime."</p>

<p>We still said "No, thank you," and we began
to feel very uncomfy, for the gentleman's
eyes were now rolling wildly.</p>

<p>"Then I'll <i>make</i> you!" he said, catching
hold of Oswald.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"You jolly well won't," cried Dicky, catching
hold of the arm of the gentleman.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 503px;">
<img src="images/gs28.png" width="503" height="400" alt="&quot;THEN I&#39;LL MAKE YOU!&quot; HE SAID, CATCHING HOLD OF OSWALD." title="&quot;THEN I&#39;LL MAKE YOU!&quot; HE SAID, CATCHING HOLD OF OSWALD." />
<span class="caption">&quot;THEN I&#39;LL MAKE YOU!&quot; HE SAID, CATCHING HOLD OF OSWALD.</span>
</div>
<p>Then Dora said very primly and speaking
rather slowly, and she was very pale&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think it would be lovely to fly. Will
you just show me how the flying-machine
looks when it is unfolded?"</p>

<p>The gentleman dropped Oswald, and Dora
made "Go! go" with her lips without speaking,
while he began to unfold the flying-machine.
We others went, Oswald lingering last, and
then in an instant Dora had nipped out of
the room and banged the door and locked it.</p>

<p>"To the Mill!" she cried, and we ran like
mad, and got in and barred the big door, and
went up to the first floor, and looked out of
the big window to warn off Mrs. Beale.</p>

<p>And we thumped Dora on the back, and
Dicky called her a Sherlock Holmes, and
No&euml;l said she was a heroine.</p>

<p>"It wasn't anything," Dora said, just before
she began to cry, "only I remember reading
that you must pretend to humour them, and
then get away, for of course I saw at once
he was a lunatic. Oh, how awful it might
have been! He could have made us all jump
out of the attic window, and there would have
been no one left to tell Father. Oh! oh!"
and then the crying began.</p>

<p>But we were proud of Dora, and I am sorry
we make fun of her sometimes, but it is
difficult not to.</p>

<p>We decided to signal the first person that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
passed, and we got Alice to take off her red
flannel petticoat for a signal.</p>

<p>The first people who came were two men in a
dog-cart. We waved the signalising petticoat
and they pulled up, and one got out and came
up to the Mill.</p>

<p>We explained about the lunatic and the
wanting us to jump out of the windows.</p>

<p>"Right oh!" cried the man to the one still
in the cart; "got him." And the other hitched
the horse to the gate and came over, and the
other went to the house.</p>

<p>"Come along down, young ladies and gentlemen,"
said the second man when he had been
told. "He's as gentle as a lamb. He does not
think it hurts to jump out of windows. He
thinks it really is flying. He'll be like an
angel when he sees the doctor."</p>

<p>We asked if he had been mad before,
because we had thought he might have suddenly
gone so.</p>

<p>"Certainly he has!" replied the man; "he
has never been, so to say, himself since tumbling
out of a flying-machine he went up in
with a friend. He was an artist previous to
that&mdash;an excellent one, I believe. But now he
only draws objects with wings&mdash;and now and
then he wants to make people fly&mdash;perfect
strangers sometimes, like yourselves. Yes,
miss, I am his attendant, and his pictures
often amuse me by the half-hours together,
poor gentleman."</p>

<p>"How did he get away?" Alice asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, miss, the poor gentleman's brother
got hurt and Mr. Sidney&mdash;that's him inside&mdash;seemed
wonderfully put out and hung over
the body in a way pitiful to see. But
really he was extracting the cash from the
sufferer's pockets. Then, while all of us
were occupied with Mr. Eustace, Mr. Sidney
just packs his portmanteau and out he goes
by the back door. When we missed him
we sent for Dr. Baker, but by the time he
came it was too late to get here. Dr. Baker
said at once he'd revert to his boyhood's home.
And the doctor has proved correct."</p>

<p>We had all come out of the Mill, and with
this polite person we went to the gate, and
saw the lunatic get into the carriage, very
gentle and gay.</p>

<p>"But, Doctor," Oswald said, "he did say
he'd give nine pounds a week for the rooms.
Oughtn't he to pay?"</p>

<p>"You might have known he was mad to say
that," said the doctor. "No. Why should
he, when it's his own sister's house? Gee
up!"</p>

<p>And he left us.</p>

<p>It was sad to find the gentleman was not
a Higher Life after all, but only mad. And I
was more sorry than ever for poor Miss
Sandal. As Oswald pointed out to the girls
they are much more blessed in their brothers
than Miss Sandal is, and they ought to be
more grateful than they are.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE SMUGGLER'S REVENGE</i></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> days went on and Miss Sandal did not
return. We went on being very sorry about
Miss Sandal being so poor, and it was not
our fault that when we tried to let the house
in lodgings, the first lodger proved to be a
lunatic of the deepest dye. Miss Sandal must
have been a fairly decent sort, because she
seems not to have written to Father about it.
At any rate he didn't give it us in any of our
letters, about our good intentions and their
ending in a maniac.</div>

<p>Oswald does not like giving up a thing just
because it has once been muffed. The muffage
of a plan is a thing that often happens at
first to heroes&mdash;like Bruce and the spider, and
other great characters. Beside, grown-ups
always say&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"If at first you don't succeed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Try, try, try again!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>And if this is the rule for Euclid and rule-of-three
and all the things you would rather not
do, think how much more it must be the rule
when what you are after is your own idea, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
not just the rotten notion of that beast Euclid,
or the unknown but equally unnecessary
author who composed the multiplication table.
So we often talked about what we could do
to make Miss Sandal rich. It gave us something
to jaw about when we happened to
want to sit down for a bit, in between all the
glorious wet sandy games that happen by the
sea.</div>

<p>Of course if we wanted real improving conversation
we used to go up to the boat-house
and talk to the coastguards. I do think
coastguards are A1. They are just the same
as sailors, having been so in their youth, and
you can get at them to talk to, which is not
the case with sailors who are at sea (or even
in harbours) on ships. Even if you had the
luck to get on to a man-of-war, you would
very likely not be able to climb to the top-gallants
to talk to the man there. Though in
books the young hero always seems able to
climb to the mast-head the moment he is told
to. The coastguards told us tales of Southern
ports, and of shipwrecks, and officers they
had <i>not</i> cottoned to, and messmates that
they <i>had</i>, but when we asked them about
smuggling they said there wasn't any to speak
of nowadays.</p>

<p>"I expect they think they oughtn't to talk
about such dark crimes before innocent kids
like us," said Dicky afterwards, and he grinned
as he said it.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Alice; "they don't know how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
much we know about smugglers, and bandits,
and highwaymen, and burglars, and coiners,"
and she sighed, and we all felt sad to think
that we had not now any chance to play at
being these things.</p>

<p>"We might play smugglers," said Oswald.</p>

<p>But he did not speak hopefully. The worst
of growing up is that you seem to want more
and more to have a bit of the real thing in
your games. Oswald could not now be content
to play at bandits and just capture
Albert next door, as once, in happier days, he
was pleased and proud to do.</p>

<p>It was not a coastguard that told us about
the smugglers. It was a very old man that
we met two or three miles along the beach.
He was leaning against a boat that was wrong
way up on the shingle, and smoking the
strongest tobacco Oswald's young nose has
ever met. I think it must have been Black
Jack. We said, "How do you do?" and Alice
said, "Do you mind if we sit down near
you?"</p>

<p>"Not me," replied the aged seafarer. We
could see directly that he was this by his
jersey and his sea-boots.</p>

<p>The girls sat down on the beach, but we
boys leaned against the boat like the seafaring
one. We hoped he would join in conversation,
but at first he seemed too proud.
And there was something dignified about him,
bearded and like a Viking, that made it hard
for us to begin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>At last he took his pipe out of his mouth
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here's a precious Quakers' meeting! You
didn't set down here just for to look at me?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure you look very nice," Dora said.</p>

<p>"Same to you, miss, I'm sure," was the
polite reply.</p>

<p>"We want to talk to you awfully," said
Alice, "if you don't mind?"</p>

<p>"Talk away," said he.</p>

<p>And then, as so often happens, no one could
think of anything to say.</p>

<p>Suddenly No&euml;l said, "<i>I</i> think you look nice
too, but I think you look as though you had
a secret history. Have you?"</p>

<p>"Not me," replied the Viking-looking
stranger. "I ain't got no history, nor jog-graphy
neither. They didn't give us that
much schooling when I was a lad."</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied No&euml;l; "but what I really
meant was, were you ever a pirate or anything?"</p>

<p>"Never in all my born," replied the stranger,
now thoroughly roused; "I'd scorn the haction.
I was in the navy, I was, till I lost the sight
of my eye, looking too close at gunpowder.
Pirates is snakes, and they ought to be killed
as such."</p>

<p>We felt rather sorry, for though of course
it is very wrong to be a pirate, it is very
interesting too. Things are often like this.
That is one of the reasons why it is so hard
to be truly good.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Dora was the only one who was pleased.
She said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, pirates <i>are</i> very wrong. And so are
highwaymen and smugglers."</p>

<p>"I don't know about highwaymen," the old
man replied; "they went out afore my time,
worse luck; but my father's great-uncle by the
mother's side, he see one hanged once. A fine
upstanding fellow he was, and made a speech
while they was a-fitting of the rope. All the
women was snivelling and sniffing and throwing
bokays at him."</p>

<p>"Did any of the bouquets reach him?"
asked the interested Alice.</p>

<p>"Not likely," said the old man. "Women
can't never shy straight. But I shouldn't
wonder but what them posies heartened the
chap up a bit. An afterwards they was all
a-fightin' to get a bit of the rope he was
hung with, for luck."</p>

<p>"Do tell us some more about him," said all
of us but Dora.</p>

<p>"I don't know no more about him. He was
just hung&mdash;that's all. They was precious fond
o' hangin' in them old far-away times."</p>

<p>"Did you ever know a smuggler?" asked
H.O.&mdash;"to speak to, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's tellings," said the old man, and
he winked at us all.</p>

<p>So then we instantly knew that the coastguards
had been mistaken when they said there
were no more smugglers now, and that this
brave old man would not betray his comrades,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
even to friendly strangers like us. But of
course he could not know exactly how friendly
we were. So we told him.</p>

<p>Oswald said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We <i>love</i> smugglers. We wouldn't even
tell a word about it if you would only tell us."</p>

<p>"There used to be lots of smuggling on
these here coasts when my father was a boy,"
he said; "my own father's cousin, his father
took to the smuggling, and he was a doin' so
well at it, that what does he do, but goes and
gets married, and the Preventives they goes
and nabs him on his wedding-day, and walks
him straight off from the church door, and
claps him in Dover Jail."</p>

<p>"Oh, his poor wife," said Alice, "whatever
did she do?"</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> didn't do nothing," said the old man.
"It's a woman's place not to do nothing till she's
told to. He'd done so well at the smuggling,
he'd saved enough by his honest toil to take
a little public. So she sets there awaitin' and
attendin' to customers&mdash;for well she knowed
him, as he wasn't the chap to let a bit of a
jail stand in the way of his station in life.
Well, it was three weeks to a day after the
wedding, there comes a dusty chap to the
'Peal of Bells' door. That was the sign over
the public, you understand."</p>

<p>We said we did, and breathlessly added,
"Go on!"</p>

<p>"A dusty chap he was; got a beard and a
patch over one eye, and he come of a afternoon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
when there was no one about the place
but her.</p>

<p>"'Hullo, missis,' says he; 'got a room for a
quiet chap?'</p>

<p>"'I don't take in no men-folks,' says she;
'can't be bothered with 'em.'</p>

<p>"'You'll be bothered with <i>me</i>, if I'm not
mistaken,' says he.</p>

<p>"'Bothered if I will,' says she.</p>

<p>"'Bothered if you won't,' says he, and with
that he ups with his hand and off comes the
black patch, and he pulls off the beard and
gives her a kiss and a smack on the shoulder.
She always said she nearly died when she see
it was her new-made bridegroom under the
beard.</p>

<p>"So she took her own man in as a lodger,
and he went to work up at Upton's Farm
with his beard on, and of nights he kept up
the smuggling business. And for a year or
more no one knowd as it was him. But they
got him at last."</p>

<p>"What became of him?" We all asked it.</p>

<p>"He's dead," said the old man. "But, Lord
love you, so's everybody as lived in them far-off
old ancient days&mdash;all dead&mdash;Preventives
too&mdash;and smugglers and gentry: all gone
under the daisies."</p>

<p>We felt quite sad. Oswald hastily asked if
there wasn't any smuggling now.</p>

<p>"Not hereabouts," the old man answered,
rather quickly for him. "Don't you go for
to think it. But I did know a young chap&mdash;quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
young he is with blue eyes&mdash;up Sunderland
way it was. He'd got a goodish bit o'
baccy and stuff done up in a ole shirt. And
as he was a-goin' up off of the beach a coastguard
jumps out at him, and he says to himself,
'All u. p. this time,' says he. But out
loud he says, 'Hullo, Jack, that you? I
thought you was a tramp,' says he.</p>

<p>"'What you got in that bundle?' says the
coastguard.</p>

<p>"'My washing,' says he, 'and a couple pairs
of old boots.'</p>

<p>"Then the coastguard he says, 'Shall I give
you a lift with it?' thinking in himself the
other chap wouldn't part if it was anything it
oughtn't to be. But that young chap was too
sharp. He says to himself, 'If I don't he'll
nail me, and if I do&mdash;well, there's just a
chance.'</p>

<p>"So he hands over the bundle, and the
coastguard he thinks it must be all right, and
he carries it all the way up to his mother's for
him, feeling sorry for the mean suspicions
he'd had about the poor old chap. But that
didn't happen near here. No, no."</p>

<p>I think Dora was going to say, "<i>Old</i> chap&mdash;but
I thought he was young with blue eyes?"
but just at that minute a coastguard came
along and ordered us quite harshly not to
lean on the boat. He was quite disagreeable
about it&mdash;how different from our own coastguards!
He was from a different station to
theirs. The old man got off very slowly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
And all the time he was arranging his long
legs so as to stand on them, the coastguard
went on being disagreeable as hard as he
could, in a loud voice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">A COASTGUARD ORDERED US QUITE HARSHLY NOT TO LEAN ON THE BOAT.</span>
</div>

<p>When our old man had told the coastguard
that no one ever lost anything by keeping a
civil tongue in his head, we all went away
feeling very angry.</p>

<p>Alice took the old man's hand as we went
back to the village, and asked him why the
coastguard was so horrid.</p>

<p>"They gets notions into their heads," replied
the old man; "the most innocentest people
they comes to think things about. It's along
of there being no smuggling in these ere parts
now. The coastguards ain't got nothing to
do except think things about honest people."</p>

<p>We parted from the old man very warmly,
all shaking hands. He lives at a cottage not
quite in the village, and keeps pigs. We
did not say goodbye till we had seen all
the pigs.</p>

<p>I daresay we should not have gone on disliking
that disagreeable coastguard so much if
he had not come along one day when we were
talking to our own coastguards, and asked
why they allowed a pack of young shavers
in the boat-house. We went away in silent
dignity, but we did not forget, and when we
were in bed that night Oswald said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't you think it would be a good thing
if the coastguards had something to do?"</p>

<p>Dicky yawned and said he didn't know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should like to be a smuggler," said
Oswald. "Oh, yes, go to sleep if you like;
but I've got an idea, and if you'd rather be
out of it I'll have Alice instead."</p>

<p>"Fire away!" said Dicky, now full of attention,
and leaning on his elbow.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Oswald, "I think we
<i>might</i> be smugglers."</p>

<p>"We've played all those things so jolly
often," said Dicky.</p>

<p>"But I don't mean play," said Oswald. "I
mean the real thing. Of course we should
have to begin in quite a small way. But we
should get on in time. And we might make
quite a lot for poor Miss Sandal."</p>

<p>"Things that you smuggle are expensive,"
said Dicky.</p>

<p>"Well, we've got the chink the Indian uncle
sent us on Saturday. I'm certain we could do
it. We'd get some one to take us out at night
in one of the fishing-boats&mdash;just tear across to
France and buy a keg or a bale or something,
and rush back."</p>

<p>"Yes, and get nabbed and put in prison.
Not me," said Dicky. "Besides, who'd take
us?"</p>

<p>"That old Viking man would," said Oswald;
"but of course, if you funk it!"</p>

<p>"I don't funk anything," said Dicky, "bar
making an ape of myself. Keep your hair on,
Oswald. Look here. Suppose we get a keg
with nothing in it&mdash;or just water. We should
have all the fun, and if we <i>were</i> collared we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
should have the laugh of that coastguard
brute."</p>

<p>Oswald agreed, but he made it a condition
that we should call it the keg of brandy,
whatever was in it, and Dicky consented.</p>

<p>Smuggling is a manly sport, and girls are
not fitted for it by nature. At least Dora is
not; and if we had told Alice she would have
insisted on dressing as a boy and going too,
and we knew Father would not like this.
And we thought No&euml;l and H.O. were too young
to be smugglers with any hope of success.
So Dicky and I kept the idea to ourselves.</p>

<p>We went to see the Viking man the next
day. It took us some time to make him
understand what we wanted, but when he
did understand he slapped his leg many times,
and very hard, and declared that we were
chips of the old block.</p>

<p>"But I can't go for to let you," he said; "if
you was nailed it's the stone jug, bless your
hearts."</p>

<p>So then we explained about the keg really
having only water in, and he slapped his leg
again harder than ever, so that it would really
have been painful to any but the hardened leg
of an old sea-dog. But the water made his
refusals weaker, and at last he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, see here, Benenden, him as owns
the <i>Mary Sarah</i>, he's often took out a youngster
or two for the night's fishing, when their
pa's and ma's hadn't no objection. You write
your pa, and ask if you mayn't go for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
night's fishing, or you get Mr. Charteris to
write. He knows it's all right, and often
done by visitors' kids, if boys. And if your
pa says yes, I'll make it all right with
Benenden. But mind, it's just a night's
fishing. No need to name no kegs. That's
just betwixt ourselves."</p>

<p>So we did exactly as he said. Mr. Charteris
is the clergyman. He was quite nice about
it, and wrote for us, and Father said "Yes,
but be very careful, and don't take the girls
or the little ones."</p>

<p>We showed the girls the letter, and that
removed the trifling ill-feeling that had grown
up through Dick and me having so much
secret talk about kegs and not telling the
others what was up.</p>

<p>Of course we never breathed a word about
kegs in public, and only to each other in bated
breaths.</p>

<p>What Father said about not taking the
girls or the little ones of course settled any
wild ideas Alice might have had of going as a
cabin-girl.</p>

<p>The old Viking man, now completely interested
in our scheme, laid all the plans in the
deepest-laid way you can think. He chose a
very dark night&mdash;fortunately there was one
just coming on. He chose the right time of
the tide for starting, and just in the greyness
of the evening when the sun is gone down,
and the sea somehow looks wetter than at
any other time, we put on our thick undershirts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and then our thickest suits and football
jerseys over everything, because we had been
told it would be very cold. Then we said
goodbye to our sisters and the little ones,
and it was exactly like a picture of the "Tar's
Farewell," because we had bundles, with things
to eat tied up in blue checked handkerchiefs,
and we said goodbye to them at the gate, and
they would kiss us.</p>

<p>Dora said, "Goodbye, I <i>know</i> you'll be
drowned. I hope you'll enjoy yourselves,
I'm sure!"</p>

<p>Alice said, "I do think it's perfectly beastly.
You might just as well have asked for me to
go with you; or you might let us come and
see you start."</p>

<p>"Men must work, and women must weep,"
replied Oswald with grim sadness, "and the
Viking said he wouldn't have us at all unless
we could get on board in a concealed manner,
like stowaways. He said a lot of others
would want to go too if they saw us."</p>

<p>We made our way to the beach, and we
tried to conceal ourselves as much as possible,
but several people did see us.</p>

<p>When we got to the boat we found she was
manned by our Viking and Benenden, and a
boy with red hair, and they were running her
down to the beach on rollers. Of course
Dicky and I lent a hand, shoving at the
stern of the boat when the men said, "Yo,
ho! Heave ho, my merry boys all!" It
wasn't exactly that that they said, but it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
meant the same thing, and we heaved like
anything.</p>

<p>It was a proud moment when her nose
touched the water, and prouder still when
only a small part of her stern remained on
the beach and Mr. Benenden remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>"All aboard!"</p>

<p>The red boy gave a "leg up" to Dicky and
me and clambered up himself. Then the two
men gave the last shoves to the boat, already
cradled almost entirely on the bosom of the
deep, and as the very end of the keel grated
off the pebbles into the water, they leaped for
the gunwale and hung on it with their high
sea-boots waving in the evening air.</p>

<p>By the time they had brought their legs on
board and coiled a rope or two, we chanced to
look back, and already the beach seemed quite
a long way off.</p>

<p>We were really afloat. Our smuggling
expedition was no longer a dream, but a
real realness. Oswald felt almost too excited
at first to be able to enjoy himself. I
hope you will understand this and not think
the author is trying to express, by roundabout
means, that the sea did not agree with Oswald.
This is not the case. He was perfectly well
the whole time. It was Dicky who was not.
But he said it was the smell of the cabin, and
not the sea, and I am sure he thought what
he said was true.</p>

<p>In fact, that cabin was a bit stiff altogether,
and was almost the means of upsetting even
Oswald.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>It was about six feet square, with bunks
and an oil stove, and heaps of old coats and
tarpaulins and sou'-westers and things, and it
smelt of tar, and fish, and paraffin-smoke, and
machinery oil, and of rooms where no one
ever opens the window.</p>

<p>Oswald just put his nose in, and that was
all. He had to go down later, when some
fish was cooked and eaten, but by that time
he had got what they call your sea-legs; but
Oswald felt more as if he had got a sea-waistcoat,
rather as if he had got rid of a
land-waistcoat that was too heavy and too
tight.</p>

<p>I will not weary the reader by telling about
how the nets are paid out and dragged in, or
about the tumbling, shining heaps of fish that
come up all alive over the side of the boat, and
it tips up with their weight till you think it is
going over. It was a very good catch that
night, and Oswald is glad he saw it, for it was
very glorious. Dicky was asleep in the cabin
at the time and missed it. It was deemed best
not to rouse him to fresh sufferings.</p>

<p>It was getting latish, and Oswald, though
thrilled in every marrow, was getting rather
sleepy, when old Benenden said, "There
she is!"</p>

<p>Oswald could see nothing at first, but
presently he saw a dark form on the
smooth sea. It turned out to be another
boat.</p>

<p>She crept quietly up till she was alongside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
ours, and then a keg was hastily hoisted from
her to us.</p>

<p>A few words in low voices were exchanged.
Oswald only heard&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sure you ain't give us the wrong un?"</p>

<p>And several people laughed hoarsely.</p>

<p>On first going on board Oswald and Dicky
had mentioned kegs, and had been ordered to
"Stow that!" so that Oswald had begun to
fear that after all it <i>was</i> only a night's fishing,
and that his glorious idea had been abandoned.</p>

<p>But now he saw the keg his trembling
heart was reassured.</p>

<p>It got colder and colder. Dicky, in the
cabin, was covered with several coats richly
scented with fish, and Oswald was glad to
accept an oilskin and sou'-wester, and to sit
down on some spare nets.</p>

<p>Until you are out on the sea at night you
can never have any idea how big the world
really is. The sky looks higher up, and the
stars look further off, and even if you know it
is only the English Channel, yet it is just as
good for feeling small on as the most trackless
Atlantic or Pacific. Even the fish help to show
the largeness of the world, because you think
of the deep deepness of the dark sea they
come up out of in such rich profusion. The
hold was full of fish after the second haul.</p>

<p>Oswald sat leaning against the precious keg,
and perhaps the bigness and quietness of
everything had really rendered him unconscious.
But he did not know he was asleep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
until the Viking man woke him up by kindly
shaking him and saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here, look alive! Was ye thinking to beach
her with that there precious keg of yours all
above board, and crying out to be broached?"</p>

<p>So then Oswald roused himself, and the keg
was rolled on to the fish where they lay filling
the hold, and armfuls of fish thrown over it.</p>

<p>"Is it <i>really</i> only water?" asked Oswald.
"There's an awfully odd smell." And indeed,
in spite of the many different smells that are
natural to a fishing-boat, Oswald began to
notice a strong scent of railway refreshment-rooms.</p>

<p>"In course it's only water," said the Viking.
"What else would it be likely to be?" and
Oswald thinks he winked in the dark.</p>

<p>Perhaps Oswald fell asleep again after this.
It was either that or deep thought. Any
way, he was aroused from it by a bump,
and a soft grating sound, and he thought
at first the boat was being wrecked on a
coral reef or something.</p>

<p>But almost directly he knew that the boat
had merely come ashore in the proper
manner, so he jumped up.</p>

<p>You cannot push a boat out of the water
like you push it in. It has to be hauled up
by a capstan. If you don't know what that is
the author is unable to explain, but there is
a picture of one.</p>

<p>When the boat was hauled up we got out,
and it was very odd to stretch your legs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
on land again. It felt shakier than being
on sea. The red-haired boy went off to get
a cart to take the shining fish to market, and
Oswald decided to face the mixed-up smells of
that cabin and wake Dicky.</p>

<p>Dicky was not grateful to Oswald for his
thoughtful kindness in letting him sleep
through the perils of the deep and his own
uncomfortableness.</p>

<p>He said, "I do think you might have waked
a chap. I've simply been out of everything."</p>

<p>Oswald did not answer back. His is a
proud and self-restraining nature. He just
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, hurry up, now, and see them cart
the fish away."</p>

<p>So we hurried up, and as Oswald came out
of the cabin he heard strange voices, and his
heart leaped up like the persons who "behold
a rainbow in the sky," for one of the voices
was the voice of that inferior and unsailorlike
coastguard from Longbeach, who had gone
out of his way to be disagreeable to Oswald
and his brothers and sisters on at least two
occasions. And now Oswald felt almost sure
that his disagreeablenesses, though not exactly
curses, were coming home to roost just as
though they had been.</p>

<p>"You're missing your beauty sleep, Stokes,"
we heard our Viking remark.</p>

<p>"I'm not missing anything else, though,"
replied the coastguard.</p>

<p>"Like half a dozen mackerel for your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
breakfast?" inquired Mr. Benenden in kindly
accents.</p>

<p>"I've no stomach for fish, thank you all the
same," replied Mr. Stokes coldly.</p>

<p>He walked up and down on the beach,
clapping his arms to keep himself warm.</p>

<p>"Going to see us unload her?" asked Mr.
Benenden.</p>

<p>"If it's all the same to you," answered the
disagreeable coastguard.</p>

<p>He had to wait a long time, for the cart did
not come, and did not come, and kept on not
coming for ages and ages. When it did the
men unloaded the boat, carrying the fish by
basketfuls to the cart.</p>

<p>Every one played up jolly well. They took
the fish from the side of the hold where the
keg wasn't till there was quite a deep hole
there, and the other side, where the keg
really was, looked like a mountain in comparison.</p>

<p>This could be plainly seen by the detested
coastguard, and by three of his companions
who had now joined him.</p>

<p>It was beginning to be light, not daylight,
but a sort of ghost-light that you could hardly
believe was the beginning of sunshine, and the
sky being blue again instead of black.</p>

<p>The hated coastguard got impatient. He
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'd best own up. It'll be the better for
you. It's bound to come out, along of the fish.
I know it's there. We've had private information<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
up at the station. The game's up this
time, so don't you make no mistake."</p>

<p>Mr. Benenden and the Viking and the boy
looked at each other.</p>

<p>"An' what might your precious private
information have been about?" asked Mr.
Benenden.</p>

<p>"Brandy," replied the coastguard Stokes,
and he went and got on to the gunwale.
"And what's more, I can smell it from
here."</p>

<p>Oswald and Dicky drew near, and the
refreshment-room smell was stronger than
ever. And a brown corner of the keg was
peeping out.</p>

<p>"There you are!" cried the Loathed One.
"Let's have that gentleman out, if you please,
and then you'll all just come alonger me."</p>

<p>Remarking, with a shrug of the shoulders,
that he supposed it was all up, our Viking
scattered the fish that hid the barrel, and
hoisted it out from its scaly bed.</p>

<p>"That's about the size of it," said the
coastguard we did not like. "Where's the
rest?"</p>

<p>"That's all," said Mr. Benenden. "We're
poor men, and we has to act according to
our means."</p>

<p>"We'll see the boat clear to her last timber,
if you've no objections," said the Detestable
One.</p>

<p>I could see that our gallant crew were prepared
to go through with the business. More<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and more of the coastguards were collecting,
and I understood that what the crew wanted
was to go up to the coastguard station with
that keg of pretending brandy, and involve
the whole of the coastguards of Longbeach
in one complete and perfect sell.</p>

<p>But Dicky was sick of the entire business.
He really has not the proper soul for adventures,
and what soul he has had been damped
by what he had gone through.</p>

<p>So he said, "Look here, there's nothing in
that keg but water."</p>

<p>Oswald could have kicked him, though he is
his brother.</p>

<p>"Huh!" replied the Unloved One, "d'you
think I haven't got a nose? Why, it's oozing
out of the bunghole now as strong as Samson."</p>

<p>"Open it and see," said Dicky, disregarding
Oswald's whispered instructions to him to
shut up. "It <i>is</i> water."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose I suppose you want
to get water from the other side for, you
young duffer!" replied the brutal official.
"There's plenty water and to spare this side."</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's <i>French</i> water," replied Dicky
madly; "it's ours, my brother's and mine.
We asked these sailors to get it for us."</p>

<p>"Sailors, indeed!" said the hateful coastguard.
"You come along with me."</p>

<p>And our Viking said he was something or
othered. But Benenden whispered to him in
a low voice that it was all right&mdash;time was up.
No one heard this but me and the Viking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to go home," said Dicky. "I don't
want to come along with you."</p>

<p>"What did you want water for?" was
asked. "To try it?"</p>

<p>"To stand you a drink next time you
ordered us off your beastly boat," said Dicky.
And Oswald rejoiced to hear the roar of
laughter that responded to this fortunate
piece of cheek.</p>

<p>I suppose Dicky's face was so angel-like,
innocent-looking, like stowaways in books,
that they <i>had</i> to believe him. Oswald told
him so afterwards, and Dicky hit out.</p>

<p>Any way, the keg was broached, and sure
enough it was water, and sea-water at that,
as the Unamiable One said when he had
tasted it out of a tin cup, for nothing else
would convince him. "But I smell brandy
still," he said, wiping his mouth after the
sea-water.</p>

<p>Our Viking slowly drew a good-sized flat
labelled bottle out of the front of his jersey.</p>

<p>"From the 'Old Ship,'" he said gently.
"I may have spilt a drop or two here or
there over the keg, my hand not being very
steady, as is well known, owing to spells of
marsh fever as comes over me every six weeks
to the day."</p>

<p>The coastguard that we never could bear
said, "Marsh fever be something or othered,"
and his comrades said the same. But they all
blamed <i>him</i>, and we were glad.</p>

<p>We went home sleepy, but rejoicing. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
whole thing was as complete a sell as ever
I wish to see.</p>

<span class="caption">SURE ENOUGH IT WAS SEA-WATER, AS THE UNAMIABLE ONE SAID WHEN HE HAD TASTED IT.</span>
</div>

<p>Of course we told our own dear and respected
Lymchurch coastguards, and I think
they may be trusted not to let it down on
the Longbeach coastguards for many a good
day. If their memories get bad I think there
will always be plenty of people along that
coast to remind them!</p>

<p>So <i>that's</i> all right.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When we had told the girls all, and borne
their reproaches for not telling them before,
we decided to give the Viking five bob for the
game way he had played up.</p>

<p>So we did. He would not take it at first,
but when we said, "Do&mdash;you might buy a pig
with it, and call it Stokes after that coastguard,"
he could no longer resist, and accepted
our friendly gift.</p>

<p>We talked with him for a bit, and when
we were going we thanked him for being so
jolly, and helping us to plant out the repulsive
coastguard so thoroughly.</p>

<p>Then he said, "Don't mention it. Did you
tell your little gells what you was up to?"</p>

<p>"No," said Oswald, "not till afterwards."</p>

<p>"Then you <i>can</i> hold your tongues. Well,
since you've acted so handsome about that
there pig, what's to be named for Stokes, I
don't mind if I tells you something. Only
mum's the word."</p>

<p>We said we were quite sure it was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then," said he, leaning over the pig-stye
wall, and rubbing the spotted pig's back
with his stick. "It's an ill wind that blows
no good to nobody. You see, that night
there was a little bird went an' whispered to
'em up at Longbeach about our little bit of a
keg. So when we landed they was there."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Oswald.</p>

<p>"Well, if they was there they couldn't be
somewheres else, could they?"</p>

<p>We owned they could not.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," he went on, "but
what a bit of a cargo was run that night
further up the beach: something as <i>wasn't</i>
sea-water. I don't say it was so, mind&mdash;and
mind you don't go for to say it."</p>

<p>Then we understood that there is a little
smuggling done still, and that we had helped
in it, though quite without knowing.</p>

<p>We were jolly glad. Afterwards, when we
had had that talk with Father, when he told
us that the laws are made by the English
people, and it is dishonourable for an Englishman
not to stick to them, we saw that
smuggling must be wrong.</p>

<p>But we have never been able to feel really
sorry. I do not know why this is.</p>

<h2><i>ZA&Iuml;DA, THE MYSTERIOUS PROPHETESS<br />
OF THE GOLDEN<br />
ORIENT</i></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">This</span> is the story of how we were gipsies and
wandering minstrels. And, like everything
else we did about that time, it was done to
make money for Miss Sandal, whose poorness
kept on, making our kind hearts ache.</div>

<p>It is rather difficult to get up any good game
in a house like Miss Sandal's, where there is
nothing lying about, except your own things,
and where everything is so neat and necessary.
Your own clothes are seldom interesting, and
even if you change hats with your sisters it
is not a complete disguise.</p>

<p>The idea of being gipsies was due to Alice.
She had not at all liked being entirely out of
the smuggling affray, though Oswald explained
to her that it was her own fault for
having been born a girl. And, of course,
after the event, Dicky and I had some things
to talk about that the girls hadn't, and we
had a couple of wet days.</p>

<p>You have no idea how dull you can be in
a house like that, unless you happen to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the sort of house I mean. A house that is
meant for plain living and high thinking, like
Miss Sandal told us, may be very nice for the
high thinkers, but if you are not accustomed
to thinking high there is only the plain living
left, and it is like boiled rice for every meal
to any young mind, however much beef and
Yorkshire there may be for the young insides.
Mrs. Beale saw to our having plenty of nice
things to eat, but, alas! it is not always dinner-time,
and in between meals the cold rice-pudding
feeling is very chilling. Of course we
had the splendid drawings of winged things
made by our Flying Lodger, but you cannot
look at pictures all day long, however many
coloured chalks they are drawn with, and
however fond you may be of them.</p>

<p>Miss Sandal's was the kind of house that
makes you wander all round it and say,
"What shall we do next?" And when it
rains the little ones get cross.</p>

<p>It was the second wet day when we were
wandering round the house to the sad music
of our boots on the clean, bare boards that
Alice said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Beale has got a book at her house
called 'Napoleon's book of Fate.' You might
ask her to let you go and get it, Oswald. She
likes you best."</p>

<p>Oswald is as modest as any one I know, but
the truth is the truth.</p>

<p>"We could tell our fortunes, and read the
dark future," Alice went on. "It would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
better than high thinking without anything
particular to think about."</p>

<p>So Oswald went down to Mrs. Beale and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Bealie dear, you've got a book up at
your place. I wish you'd lend it to us to
read."</p>

<p>"If it's the Holy Book you mean, sir," replied
Mrs. Beale, going on with peeling the
potatoes that were to be a radiant vision
later on, all brown and crisp in company with
a leg of mutton&mdash;"if it's the Holy Book you
want there's one up on Miss Sandal's chest of
drawerses."</p>

<p>"I know," said Oswald. He knew every
book in the house. The backs of them were
beautiful&mdash;leather and gold&mdash;but inside they
were like whited sepulchres, full of poetry
and improving reading. "No&mdash;we didn't want
that book just now. It is a book called
'Napoleon's book of Fate.' Would you mind
if I ran up to your place and got it?"</p>

<p>"There's no one at home," said Mrs. Beale;
"wait a bit till I go along to the bakus with
the meat, and I'll fetch it along."</p>

<p>"You might let me go," said Oswald, whose
high spirit is always ill-attuned to waiting a
bit. "I wouldn't touch anything else, and I
know where you keep the key."</p>

<p>"There's precious little as ye don't know, it
seems to me," said Mrs. Beale. "There, run
along do. It's on top of the mantelshelf
alongside the picture tea-tin. It's a red book.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Don't go taking the 'Wesleyan Conference
Reports' by mistake, the two is both together
on the mantel."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 474px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;I SAY, BEALIE DEAR, YOU&#39;VE GOT A BOOK UP AT YOUR PLACE.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Oswald in his macker splashed through the
mud to Mrs. Beale's, found the key under the
loose tile behind the water-butt, and got the
book without adventure. He had promised
not to touch anything else, so he could not
make even the gentlest booby-trap as a
little surprise for Mrs. Beale when she got
back.</p>

<p>And most of that day we were telling our
fortunes by the ingenious means invented by
the great Emperor, or by cards, which it is
hard to remember the rules for, or by our
dreams. The only blights were that the
others all wanted to have the book all the
time, and that No&euml;l's dreams were so long and
mixed that we got tired of hearing about
them before he did. But he said he was quite
sure he had dreamed every single bit of every
one of them. And the author hopes this was
the truth.</p>

<p>We all went to bed hoping we should dream
something that we could look up in the
dream book, but none of us did.</p>

<p>And in the morning it was still raining and
Alice said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here, if it ever clears up again let's
dress up and be gipsies. We can go about in
the distant villages telling people's fortunes.
If you'll let me have the book all to-day I can
learn up quite enough to tell them mysteriously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and darkly. And gipsies always get
their hands crossed with silver."</p>

<p>Dicky said that was one way of keeping the
book to herself, but Oswald said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let her try. She shall have it for an
hour, and then we'll have an exam. to see
how much she knows."</p>

<p>This was done, but while she was swatting
the thing up with her fingers in her ears we
began to talk about how gipsies should be
dressed.</p>

<p>And when we all went out of the room to
see if we could find anything in that tidy
house to dress up in, she came after us to see
what was up. So there was no exam.</p>

<p>We peeped into the cupboards and drawers
in Miss Sandal's room, but everything was
grey or brown, not at all the sort of thing to
dress up for children of the Sunny South in.
The plain living was shown in all her clothes;
and besides, grey shows every little spot you
may happen to get on it.</p>

<p>We were almost in despair. We looked in
all the drawers in all the rooms, but found
only sheets and tablecloths and more grey
and brown clothing.</p>

<p>We tried the attic, with fainting hearts.
Servants' clothes are always good for dressing-up
with; they have so many different colours.
But Miss Sandal had no servant. Still, she
might have had one once, and the servant
might have left something behind her. Dora
suggested this and added<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you don't find anything in the attic
you'll know it's Fate, and you're not to do it.
Besides, I'm almost sure you can be put in
prison for telling fortunes."</p>

<p>"Not if you're a gipsy you can't," said No&euml;l;
"they have licences to tell fortunes, I believe,
and judges can't do anything to them."</p>

<p>So we went up to the attic. And it was as
bare and tidy as the rest of the house. But
there were some boxes and we looked in them.
The smallest was full of old letters, so we shut
it again at once. Another had books in it,
and the last had a clean towel spread over
what was inside. So we took off the towel,
and then every one said "Oh!"</p>

<p>In right on the top was a scarlet thing,
embroidered heavily with gold. It proved, on
unfolding, to be a sort of coat, like a Chinaman's.
We lifted it out and laid it on the
towel on the floor. And then the full glories
of that box were revealed. There were cloaks
and dresses and skirts and scarves, of all the
colours of a well-chosen rainbow, and all
made of the most beautiful silks and stuffs,
with things worked on them with silk, as well
as chains of beads and many lovely ornaments.
We think Miss Sandal must have been very
fond of pretty things when she was young, or
when she was better off.</p>

<p>"Well, there won't be any gipsies near by to
come up to <i>us</i>," said Oswald joyously.</p>

<p>"Do you think we ought to take them,
without asking?" said Dora.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course not," said Oswald witheringly;
"we ought to write to her and say, 'Please,
Miss Sandal, we know how poor you are, and
may we borrow your things to be gipsies in
so as we get money for you&mdash;&mdash; All right!
You go and write the letter, Dora."</p>

<p>"I only just asked," said Dora.</p>

<p>We tried the things on. Some of them
were so ladylike that they were no good&mdash;evening
dresses, and things like that. But
there were enough useful things to go round.
Oswald, in white shirt and flannel knee-breeches,
tied a brick-coloured silk scarf
round his middle part, and a green one round
his head for a turban. The turban was
fastened with a sparkling brooch with pink
stones in it. He looked like a Moorish
toreador. Dicky had the scarlet and gold
coat, which was the right length when Dora
had run a tuck in it.</p>

<p>Alice had a blue skirt with embroidery of
peacock's feathers on it, and a gold and black
jacket very short with no sleeves, and a
yellow silk handkerchief on her head like
Italian peasants, and another handkie round
her neck. Dora's skirt was green and her
handkerchiefs purple and pink.</p>

<p>No&euml;l insisted on having his two scarves,
one green and one yellow, twisted on his legs
like putties, and a red scarf wound round
his middle-part, and he stuck a long ostrich
feather in his own bicycle cap and said he
was a troubadour bard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>H.O. was able to wear a lady's blouse
of mouse-coloured silk, embroidered with
poppies. It came down to his knees and a
jewelled belt kept it in place.</p>

<p>We made up our costumes into bundles,
and Alice thoughtfully bought a pennyworth
of pins. Of course it was idle to suppose that
we could go through the village in our gipsy
clothes without exciting <i>some</i> remark.</p>

<p>The more we thought of it the more it
seemed as if it would be a good thing to get
some way from our village before we began
our gipsy career.</p>

<p>The woman at the sweet shop where Alice
got the pins has a donkey and cart, and for
two shillings she consented to lend us this,
so that some of us could walk while some of
us would always be resting in the cart.</p>

<p>And next morning the weather was bright
and blue as ever, and we started. We were
beautifully clean, but all our hairs had been
arranged with the brush solely, because at
the last moment nobody could find it's comb.
Mrs. Beale had packed up a jolly sandwichy
and apply lunch for us. We told her we were
going to gather bluebells in the woods, and of
course we meant to do that too.</p>

<p>The donkey-cart drew up at the door and
we started. It was found impossible to get
every one into the cart at once, so we agreed
to cast lots for who should run behind, and
to take it in turns, mile and mile. The lot
fell on Dora and H.O., but there was precious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
little running about it. Anything slower
than that donkey Oswald has never known,
and when it came to passing its own front
door the donkey simply would not. It ended
in Oswald getting down and going to the
animal's head, and having it out with him,
man to man. The donkey was small, but of
enormous strength. He set all his four feet
firm and leant back&mdash;and Oswald set his two
feet firm and leant back&mdash;so that Oswald
and the front part of the donkey formed an
angry and contentious letter V. And Oswald
gazed in the donkey's eyes in a dauntless
manner, and the donkey looked at Oswald
as though it thought he was hay or thistles.</p>

<p>Alice beat the donkey from the cart with
a stick that had been given us for the purpose.
The rest shouted. But all was in vain. And
four people in a motor car stopped it to see
the heroic struggle, and laughed till I thought
they would have upset their hateful motor.
However, it was all for the best, though
Oswald did not see it at the time. When
they had had enough of laughing they started
their machine again, and the noise it made
penetrated the donkey's dull intelligence, and
he started off without a word&mdash;I mean without
any warning, and Oswald has only just
time to throw himself clear of the wheels
before he fell on the ground and rolled over,
biting the dust.</p>

<p>The motor car people behaved as you would
expect. But accidents happen even to motor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
cars, when people laugh too long and too
unfeelingly. The driver turned round to laugh,
and the motor instantly took the bit between
its teeth and bolted into the stone wall of the
churchyard. No one was hurt except the
motor, but that had to spend the day at the
blacksmith's, we heard afterwards. Thus
was the outraged Oswald avenged by Fate.</p>

<span class="caption">ALICE BEAT THE DONKEY FROM THE CART. THE REST SHOUTED.</span>
</div>

<p>He was not hurt either&mdash;though much the
motor people would have cared if he had
been&mdash;and he caught up with the others at the
end of the village, for the donkey's pace had
been too good to last, and the triumphal
progress was resumed.</p>

<p>It was some time before we found a wood
sufficiently lurking-looking for our secret
purposes. There are no woods close to the
village. But at last, up by Bonnington, we
found one, and tying our noble steed to the
sign-post that says how many miles it is to
Ashford, we cast a hasty glance round, and
finding no one in sight disappeared in the
wood with our bundles.</p>

<p>We went in just ordinary creatures. We
came out gipsies of the deepest dye, for we
had got a pennorth of walnut stain from
Mr. Jameson the builder, and mixed with
water&mdash;the water we had brought in a
medicine-bottle&mdash;it was a prime disguise.
And we knew it would wash off, unlike the
Condy's fluid we once stained ourselves with
during a never-to-be-forgotten game of
Jungle-Book.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>We had put on all the glorious things we
had bagged from Miss Sandal's attic treasures,
but still Alice had a small bundle unopened.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Dora asked.</p>

<p>"I meant to keep it as a reserve force in
case the fortune-telling didn't turn out all
our fancy painted it," said Alice; "but I
don't mind telling you now."</p>

<p>She opened the bundle, and there was a
tambourine, some black lace, a packet of
cigarette papers, and our missing combs.</p>

<p>"What ever on earth&mdash;&mdash;" Dicky was
beginning, but Oswald saw it all. He has a
wonderfully keen nose. And he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bully for you, Alice. I wish I'd thought
it myself."</p>

<p>Alice was much pleased by this handsome
speech.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; "perhaps really it would
be best to begin with it. It would attract
the public's attention, and then we could tell
the fortunes. You see," she kindly explained
to Dicky and H.O. and Dora, who had not
seen it yet&mdash;though No&euml;l had, almost as soon
as I did&mdash;"you see, we'll all play on the
combs with the veils over our faces, so that
no one can see what our instruments are.
Why, they might be mouth-organs for anything
any one will know, or some costly
instruments from the far-off East, like they
play to sultans in zenanas. Let's just try
a tune or two before we go on, to be sure that
all the combs work right. Dora's has such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
big teeth, I shouldn't wonder if it wouldn't
act at all."</p>

<p>So we all papered our combs and did
"Heroes," but that sounded awful. "The Girl
I Left Behind Me" went better, and so did
"Bonnie Dundee." But we thought "See the
Conquering" or "The Death of Nelson"
would be the best to begin with.</p>

<p>It was beastly hot doing it under the veils,
but when Oswald had done one tune without
the veil to see how the others looked he could
not help owning that the veils did give a
hidden mystery that was a stranger to simple
combs.</p>

<p>We were all a bit puffed when we had
played for awhile, so we decided that as the
donkey seemed calm and was eating grass
and resting, we might as well follow his
example.</p>

<p>"We ought not to be too proud to take
pattern by the brute creation," said Dora.</p>

<p>So we had our lunch in the wood. We
lighted a little fire of sticks and fir-cones,
so as to be as gipsyish as we could, and we
sat round the fire. We made a charming
picture in our bright clothes, among what
would have been our native surroundings if
we had been real gipsies, and we knew how
nice we looked, and stayed there though the
smoke got in our eyes, and everything we ate
tasted of it.</p>

<p>The woods were a little damp, and that was
why the fire smoked so. There were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
jackets we had cast off when we dressed up,
to sit on, and there was a horse-cloth in the
cart intended for the donkey's wear, but we
decided that our need was greater than <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'it's'">its</ins>,
so we took the blanket to recline on.</p>

<p>It was as jolly a lunch as ever I remember,
and we lingered over that and looking romantic
till we could not bear the smoke any
more.</p>

<p>Then we got a lot of bluebells and we
trampled out the fire most carefully, because
we know about not setting woods and places
alight, rolled up our clothes in bundles, and
went out of the shadowy woodland into the
bright sunlight, as sparkling looking a crew
of gipsies as any one need wish for.</p>

<p>Last time we had seen the road it had been
quite white and bare of persons walking on
it, but now there were several. And not
only walkers, but people in carts. And some
carriages passed us too.</p>

<p>Every one stared at us, but they did not
seem so astonished as we had every right
to expect, and though interested they were
not rude, and this is very rare among English
people&mdash;and not only poor people either&mdash;when
they see anything at all out of the
way.</p>

<p>We asked one man, who was very Sunday-best
indeed in black clothes and a blue tie,
where every one was going, for every one
was going the same way, and every one
looked as if it was going to church, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
was unlikely, it being but Thursday. He
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Same place wot you're going to I expect."</p>

<p>And when we said where was that we were
requested by him to get along with us.
Which we did.</p>

<p>An old woman in the heaviest bonnet I
have ever seen and the highest&mdash;it was like a
black church&mdash;revealed the secret to us, and
we learned that there was a Primrose <i>f&ecirc;te</i>
going on in Sir Willoughby Blockson's
grounds.</p>

<p>We instantly decided to go to the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>.</p>

<p>"I've been to a Primrose <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, and so have
you, Dora," Oswald remarked, "and people
are so dull at them, they'd gladly give gold
to see the dark future. And, besides, the
villages will be unpopulated, and no one at
home but idiots and babies and their keepers."</p>

<p>So we went to the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>.</p>

<p>The people got thicker and thicker, and
when we got to Sir Willoughby's lodge gates,
which have sprawling lions on the gate-posts,
we were told to take the donkey cart round
to the stable-yard.</p>

<p>This we did, and proud was the moment
when a stiff groom had to bend his proud
stomach to go to the head of Bates's donkey.</p>

<p>"This is something like," said Alice, and
No&euml;l added:</p>

<p>"The foreign princes are well received at
this palace."</p>

<p>"We aren't princes, we're gipsies," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Dora, tucking his scarf in. It would keep
on getting loose.</p>

<p>"There <i>are</i> gipsy princes, though," said
No&euml;l, "because there are gipsy kings."</p>

<p>"You aren't always a prince first," said Dora;
"don't wriggle so or I can't fix you. Sometimes
being made a king just happens to
some one who isn't any one in particular."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said No&euml;l; "you have
to be a prince before you're a king, just as
you have to be a kitten before you're a cat,
or a puppy before you're a dog, or a worm
before you're a serpent, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What about the King of Sweden?" Dora
was beginning, when a very nice tall, thin
man, with white flowers in his buttonhole
like for a wedding, came strolling up and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"And whose show is this? Eh, what?"</p>

<p>We said it was ours.</p>

<p>"Are you expected?" he asked.</p>

<p>We said we thought not, but we hoped he
didn't mind.</p>

<p>"What are you? Acrobats? Tight-rope?
That's a ripping Burmese coat you've got
there."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. No we aren't," said Alice, with
dignity. "I am Za&iuml;da, the mysterious
prophetess of the golden Orient, and the
others are mysterious too, but we haven't
fixed on their names yet."</p>

<p>"By jove!" said the gentleman; "but who
are you really?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our names are our secret," said Oswald,
with dignity, but Alice said, "Oh, but we
don't mind telling <i>you</i>, because I'm sure you're
nice. We're really the Bastables, and we
want to get some money for some one we
know that's rather poor&mdash;of course I can't
tell you <i>her</i> name. And we've learnt how
to tell fortunes&mdash;really we have. Do you
think they'll let us tell them at the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>.
People are often dull at <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said the gentleman again&mdash;"by
Jove, they are!"</p>

<p>He plunged for a moment in deep reflection.</p>

<p>"We've got co&mdash;musical instruments,"
said No&euml;l; "shall we play to you a little?"</p>

<p>"Not here," said the gentleman; "follow
me."</p>

<p>He led the way by the backs of shrubberies
to an old summer-house, and we asked him
to wait outside.</p>

<p>Then we put on our veils and tuned up.
"See, see the conquering&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he did not let us finish the tune; he
burst in upon us, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ripping&mdash;oh, ripping! And now tell me
my fortune."</p>

<p>Alice took off her veil and looked at his
hand.</p>

<p>"You will travel in distant lands," she said;
"you will have great wealth and honour;
you will marry a beautiful lady&mdash;a very fine
woman, it says in the book, but I think a
beautiful lady sounds nicer, don't you?"</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>"Much; but I shouldn't mention the book
when you're telling the fortune."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't, except to you," said Alice,
"and she'll have lots of money and a very
sweet disposition. Trials and troubles beset
your path, but do but be brave and fearless
and you will overcome all your enemies.
Beware of a dark woman&mdash;most likely a
widow."</p>

<p>"I will," said he, for Alice had stopped for
breath. "Is that all?"</p>

<p>"No. Beware of a dark woman and shun
the society of drunkards and gamblers. Be
very cautious in your choice of acquaintances,
or you will make a false friend who will be
your ruin. That's all, except that you will
be married very soon and live to a green old
age with the beloved wife of your bosom, and
have twelve sons and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, stop!" said the gentleman; "twelve
sons are as many as I can bring up
handsomely on my present income. Now,
look here. You did that jolly well, only go
slower, and pretend to look for things in
the hand before you say them. Everything's
free at the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, so you'll get no money for
your fortune-telling."</p>

<p>Gloom was on each young brow.</p>

<p>"It's like this," he went on, "there is a lady
fortune-teller in a tent in the park."</p>

<p>"Then we may as well get along home,"
said Dicky.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said our new friend, for such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
he was now about to prove himself to be;
"that lady does not want to tell fortunes
to-day. She has a headache. Now, if you'll
really stick to it, and tell the people's fortunes
as well as you told mine, I'll stand you&mdash;let's
see&mdash;two quid for the afternoon. Will that
do? What?"</p>

<p>We said we should just jolly well think it
would.</p>

<p>"I've got some Eau de Cologne in a medicine-bottle,"
Dora said; "my brother No&euml;l has
headaches sometimes, but I think he's going
to be all right to-day. Do take it, it will do
the lady's head good."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of her head," he said, laughing,
but he took the bottle and said, "Thank you."</p>

<p>Then he told us to stay where we were
while he made final arrangements, and we
were left with palpitating breasts to look
wildly through the Book of Fate, so as to
have the things ready. But it turned out to
be time thrown away, for when he came
back he said to Alice&mdash;</p>

<p>"It'll have to be only you and your sister,
please, for I see they've stuck up a card with
'Esmeralda, the gipsy Princess, reads the hand
and foretells the future' on it. So you boys
will have to be mum. You can be attendants&mdash;mutes,
by jove!&mdash;yes that's it. And, I say,
kiddies, you will jolly well play up, won't
you? Don't stand any cheek. Stick it on,
you know. I can't tell you how important
it is about&mdash;&mdash;about the lady's headache."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should think this would be a cool place
for a headache to be quiet in," said Dora;
and it was, for it was quite hidden in the
shrubbery and no path to it.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he remarked yet once again,
"so it would. You're right!"</p>

<p>He led us out of the shrubbery and across
the park. There were people dotted all about
and they stared, but they touched their hats
to the gentleman, and he returned their salute
with stern politeness.</p>

<p>Inside the tent with "Esmeralda, &amp;c.," outside
there was a lady in a hat and dust-cloak.
But we could see her spangles under the
cloak.</p>

<p>"Now," said the gentleman to Dicky, "you
stand at the door and let people in, one at a
time. You others can just play a few bars on
your instruments for each new person&mdash;only
a very little, because you do get out of tune,
though that's barbaric certainly. Now, here's
the two quid. And you stick to the show till
five; you'll hear the stable clock chime."</p>

<p>The lady was very pale with black marks
under her eyes, and her eyes looked red,
Oswald thought. She seemed about to speak,
but the gentleman said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do trust me, Ella. I'll explain everything
directly. Just go to the old summer-house&mdash;<i>you</i>
know&mdash;and I'll be there directly. I'll take
a couple of pegs out of the back and you can
slip away among the trees. Hold your cloak
close over your gown. Goodbye, kiddies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Stay, give me your address, and I'll write and
tell you if my fortune comes true."</p>

<p>So he shook hands with us and went. And
we did stick to it, though it is far less fun
than you would think telling fortunes all the
afternoon in a stuffy tent, while outside you
know there are things to eat and people
enjoying themselves. But there were the two
gold quid, and we were determined to earn
them. It is very hard to tell a different
fortune for each person, and there were a
great many. The girls took it in turns, and
Oswald wonders why their hairs did not go
gray. Though of course it was much better
fun for them than for us, because we had just
to be mutes when we weren't playing on the
combs.</p>

<p>The people we told fortunes to at first
laughed rather, and said we were too young
to know anything. But Oswald said in a
hollow voice that we were as old as the
Pyramids, and after that Alice took the tucks
out of Dicky's red coat and put it on and
turbaned herself, and looked much older.</p>

<p>The stable clock had chimed the quarter to
five some little time, when an elderly gentleman
with whiskers, who afterwards proved to
be Sir Willoughby, burst into the tent.</p>

<p>"Where's Miss Blockson?" he said, and we
answered truthfully that we did not know.</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?" he
furiously asked.</p>

<p>"Ever since two," said Alice wearily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>He said a word that I should have thought
a baronet would have been above using.</p>

<p>"Who brought you here?"</p>

<p>We described the gentleman who had done
this, and again the baronet said things we
should never be allowed to say. "That confounded
Carew!" he added, with more words.</p>

<p>"Is anything wrong?" asked Dora&mdash;"can
we do anything? We'll stay on longer if you
like&mdash;if you can't find the lady who was doing
Esmeralda before we came."</p>

<p>"I'm not very likely to find her," he said
ferociously. "Stay longer indeed! Get away
out of my sight before I have you locked up
for vagrants and vagabonds."</p>

<p>He left the scene in bounding and mad fury.
We thought it best to do as he said, and went
round the back way to the stables so as to
avoid exciting his ungoverned rage by meeting
him again. We found our cart and went
home. We had got two quid and something
to talk about.</p>

<p>But none of us&mdash;not even Oswald the discerning&mdash;understood
exactly what we had
been mixed up in, till the pink satin box with
three large bottles of A1 scent in it, and
postmarks of foreign lands, came to Dora.
And there was a letter. It said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear Gipsies,&mdash;I beg to return the Eau
de Cologne you so kindly lent me. The lady
did use a little of it, but I found that foreign
travel was what she really wanted to make
her quite happy. So we caught the 4.15 to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
town, and now we are married, and intend to
live to a green old age, &amp;c., as you foretold.
But for your help my fortune couldn't have
come true, because my wife's father, Sir
Willoughby, thought I was not rich enough
to marry. But you see I was. And my wife
and I both thank you heartily for your kind
help. I hope it was not an awful swat. I
had to say five because of the train. Good
luck to you, and thanks awfully.</p>

<div class='sig'>

"<span class="smcap">Carisbrook Carew</span>."<br />
</div>

<p>If Oswald had known beforehand we should
never have made that two quid for Miss
Sandal.</p>

<p>For Oswald does not approve of marriages
and would never, if he knew it, be the means
of assisting one to occur.</p>

<h2><i>THE LADY AND THE LICENSE;<br />
OR, FRIENDSHIP'S GARLAND</i></h2>


<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">My dear Kiddies</span>,&mdash;Miss Sandal's married
sister has just come home from Australia, and
she feels very tired. No wonder, you will say,
after such a long journey. So she is going to
Lymchurch to rest. Now I want you all to be
very quiet, because when you are in your usual
form you aren't exactly restful, are you? If
this weather lasts you will be able to be out
most of the time, and when you are indoors
for goodness' sake control your lungs and your
boots, especially H.O.'s. Mrs. Bax has travelled
about a good deal, and once was nearly eaten
by cannibals. But I hope you won't bother
her to tell you stories. She is coming on
Friday. I am glad to hear from Alice's letter
that you enjoyed the Primrose F&ecirc;te. Tell
No&euml;l that 'poetticle' is not the usual way of
spelling the word he wants. I send you ten
shillings for pocket-money, and again implore
you to let Mrs. Bax have a little rest and
peace.<br />

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">"Your loving</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Father</span>."<br /></div>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>

<p>"PS.&mdash;If you want anything sent down, tell
me, and I will get Mrs. Bax to bring it. I met
your friend Mr. Red House the other day at
lunch."</p></div>

<p>When the letter had been read aloud, and
we had each read it to ourselves, a sad silence
took place.</p>

<p>Dicky was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> rather beastly, I grant you," he said,
"but it might be worse."</p>

<p>"I don't see how," said H.O. "I do wish
Father would jolly well learn to leave my
boots alone."</p>

<p>"It might be worse, I tell you," said Dicky.
"Suppose instead of telling us to keep out of
doors it had been the other way?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Alice, "suppose it had been,
'Poor Mrs. Bax requires to be cheered up.
Do not leave her side day or night. Take it
in turns to make jokes for her. Let not a
moment pass without some merry jest'? Oh
yes, it might be much, much worse."</p>

<p>"Being able to get out all day makes it all
right about trying to make that two pounds
increase and multiply," remarked Oswald.
"Now who's going to meet her at the station?
Because after all it's her sister's house, and
we've got to be polite to visitors even if we're
in a house we aren't related to."</p>

<p>This was seen to be so, but no one was
keen on going to the station. At last
Oswald, ever ready for forlorn hopes, consented
to go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>We told Mrs. Beale, and she got the best
room ready, scrubbing everything till it smelt
deliciously of wet wood and mottled soap.
And then we decorated the room as well as
we could.</p>

<p>"She'll want some pretty things," said Alice,
"coming from the land of parrots and opossums
and gum-trees and things."</p>

<p>We did think of borrowing the stuffed wild-cat
that is in the bar at the "Ship," but we
decided that our decorations must be very
quiet&mdash;and the wild-cat, even in its stuffed
state, was anything but; so we borrowed a
stuffed roach in a glass box and stood it on
the chest of drawers. It looked very calm.
Sea-shells are quiet things when they are
vacant, and Mrs. Beale let us have the four
big ones off her chiffonnier.</p>

<p>The girls got flowers&mdash;bluebells and white
wood-<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'anenomes'">anemones</ins>. We might have had poppies
or buttercups, but we thought the colours
might be too loud. We took some books up
for Mrs. Bax to read in the night. And we
took the quietest ones we could find.</p>

<p>"Sonnets on Sleep," "Confessions of an
Opium Eater," "Twilight of the Gods," "Diary
of a Dreamer," and "By Still Waters," were
some of them. The girls covered them with
grey paper, because some of the bindings were
rather gay.</p>

<p>The girls hemmed grey calico covers for the
drawers and the dressing-table, and we drew
the blinds half-down, and when all was done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the room looked as quiet as a roosting wood-pigeon.</p>

<p>We put in a clock, but we did not wind
it up.</p>

<p>"She can do that herself," said Dora, "if
she feels she can bear to hear it ticking."</p>

<p>Oswald went to the station to meet her.
He rode on the box beside the driver. When
the others saw him mount there I think they
were sorry they had not been polite and gone
to meet her themselves. Oswald had a jolly
ride. We got to the station just as the train
came in. Only one lady got out of it, so
Oswald knew it must be Mrs. Bax. If he had
not been told how quiet she wanted to be he
would have thought she looked rather jolly.
She had short hair and gold spectacles. Her
skirts were short, and she carried a parrot-cage
in her hand. It contained our parrot,
and when we wrote to tell Father that it and
Pincher were the only things we wanted sent
we never thought she would have brought
either.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bax, I believe," was the only break
Oswald made in the polite silence that he took
the parrot-cage and her bag from her in.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" she said very briskly for
a tired lady; and Oswald thought it was noble
of her to make the effort to smile. "Are you
Oswald or Dicky?"</p>

<p>Oswald told her in one calm word which
he was, and then Pincher rolled madly out
of a dog-box almost into his arms. Pincher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
would not be quiet. Of course he did not
understand the need for it. Oswald conversed
with Pincher in low, restraining whispers as
he led the way to the "Ship's" fly. He put the
parrot-cage on the inside seat of the carriage,
held the door open for Mrs. Bax with silent
politeness, closed it as quietly as possible, and
prepared to mount on the box.</p>

<p>"Oh, won't you come inside?" asked Mrs.
Bax. "Do!"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said Oswald in calm and
mouse-like tones; and to avoid any more jaw
he got at once on to the box with Pincher.</p>

<p>So that Mrs. Bax was perfectly quiet for the
whole six miles&mdash;unless you count the rattle
and shake-up-and-down of the fly. On the
box Oswald and Pincher "tasted the sweets of
a blissful re-union," like it says in novels.
And the man from the "Ship" looked on
and said how well bred Pincher was. It
was a happy drive.</p>

<p>There was something almost awful about the
sleek, quiet tidiness of the others, who were
all standing in a row outside the cottage to
welcome Mrs. Bax. They all said, "How do
you do?" in hushed voices, and all looked as if
butter would not melt in any of their young
mouths. I never saw a more soothing-looking
lot of kids.</p>

<p>She went to her room, and we did not see
her again till tea-time.</p>

<p>Then, still exquisitely brushed and combed,
we sat round the board&mdash;in silence. We had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
left the tea-tray place for Mrs. Bax, of course.
But she said to Dora&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to pour out?"</p>

<p>And Dora replied in low, soft tones, "If you
wish me to, Mrs. Bax. I usually do." And
she did.</p>

<p>We passed each other bread-and-butter and
jam and honey with silent courteousness.
And of course we saw that she had enough
to eat.</p>

<p>"Do you manage to amuse yourself pretty
well here?" she asked presently.</p>

<p>We said, "Yes, thank you," in hushed
tones.</p>

<p>"What do you do?" she asked.</p>

<p>We did not wish to excite her by telling her
what we did, so Dicky murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular," at the same moment
that Alice said&mdash;</p>

<p>"All sorts of things."</p>

<p>"Tell me about them," said Mrs. Bax
invitingly.</p>

<p>We replied by a deep silence. She sighed,
and passed her cup for more tea.</p>

<p>"Do you ever feel shy," she asked suddenly.
"I do, dreadfully, with new people."</p>

<p>We liked her for saying that, and Alice
replied that she hoped she would not feel shy
with us.</p>

<p>"I hope not," she said. "Do you know,
there was such a funny woman in the train?
She had seventeen different parcels, and she
kept counting them, and one of them was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
kitten, and it was always under the seat
when she began to count, so she always got
the number wrong."</p>

<p>We should have liked to hear about that
kitten&mdash;especially what colour it was and
how old&mdash;but Oswald felt that Mrs. Bax was
only trying to talk for our sakes, so that we
shouldn't feel shy, so he simply said, "Will
you have some more cake?" and nothing
more was said about the kitten.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bax seemed very noble. She kept trying
to talk to us about Pincher, and trains and
Australia, but we were determined she should
be quiet, as she wished it so much, and we
restrained our brimming curiosity about
opossums up gum-trees, and about emus and
kangaroos and wattles, and only said "Yes"
or "No," or, more often, nothing at all.</p>

<p>When tea was over we melted away, "like
snow-wreaths in Thawjean," and went out on
the beach and had a yelling match. Our
throats felt as though they were full of wool,
from the hushed tones we had used in talking
to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Mr.'">Mrs.</ins> Bax. Oswald won the match. Next
day we kept carefully out of the way, except
for meals. Mrs. Bax tried talking again at
breakfast-time, but we checked our wish to
listen, and passed the pepper, salt, mustard,
bread, toast, butter, marmalade, and even the
cayenne, vinegar, and oil, with such politeness
that she gave up.</p>

<p>We took it in turns to watch the house and
drive away organ-grinders. We told them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
they must not play in front of that house,
because there was an Australian lady who
had to be kept quiet. And they went at once.
This cost us expense, because an organ-grinder
will never consent to fly the spot
under twopence a flight.</p>

<p>We went to bed early. We were quite
weary with being so calm and still. But we
knew it was our duty, and we liked the feel
of having done it.</p>

<p>The day after was the day Jake Lee got
hurt. Jake is the man who drives about the
country in a covered cart, with pins and
needles, and combs and frying-pans, and all
the sort of things that farmers' wives are
likely to want in a hurry, and no shops for
miles. I have always thought Jake's was a
beautiful life. I should like to do it myself.
Well, this particular day he had got his
cart all ready to start and had got his foot on
the wheel to get up, when a motor-car went
by puffing and hooting. I always think
motor-cars seem so rude somehow. And the
horse was frightened; and no wonder. It
shied, and poor Jake was thrown violently to
the ground, and hurt so much that they had
to send for the doctor. Of course we went and
asked Mrs. Jake if we could do anything&mdash;such
as take the cart out and sell the things
to the farmers' wives.</p>

<p>But she thought not.</p>

<p>It was after this that Dicky said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't we get things of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
own and go and sell them&mdash;with Bates'
donkey?"</p>

<p>Oswald was thinking the same thing, but
he wishes to be fair, so he owns that Dicky
spoke first. We all saw at once that the idea
was a good one.</p>

<p>"Shall we dress up for it?" H.O. asked.
We thought not. It is always good sport to
dress up, but I have never heard of people
selling things to farmers' wives in really
beautiful disguises.</p>

<p>"We ought to go as shabby as we can," said
Alice; "but somehow that always seems to
come natural to your clothes when you've
done a few interesting things in them. We
have plenty of clothes that look poor but
deserving. What shall we buy to sell?"</p>

<p>"Pins and needles, and tape and bodkins,"
said Dora.</p>

<p>"Butter," said No&euml;l; "it is terrible when
there is no butter."</p>

<p>"Honey is nice," said H.O., "and so are
sausages."</p>

<p>"Jake has ready-made shirts and corduroy
trousers. I suppose a farmer's shirt and
trousers may give at any moment," said Alice,
"and if he can't get new ones he has to go to
bed till they are mended."</p>

<p>Oswald thought tin-tacks, and glue, and
string must often be needed to mend barns
and farm tools with if they broke suddenly.
And Dicky said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think the pictures of ladies hanging on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
crosses in foaming seas are good. Jake told
me he sold more of them than anything. I
suppose people suddenly break the old ones,
and home isn't home without a lady holding
on to a cross."</p>

<p>We went to Munn's shop, and we bought
needles and pins, and tapes and bodkins, a
pound of butter, a pot of honey and one of
marmalade, and tin-tacks, string, and glue. But
we could not get any ladies with crosses, and
the shirts and trousers were too expensive for
us to dare to risk it. Instead, we bought a
head-stall for eighteenpence, because how
providential we should be to a farmer whose
favourite horse had escaped and he had
nothing to catch it with; and three tin-openers,
in case of a distant farm subsisting
entirely on tinned things, and the only opener
for miles lost down the well or something.
We also bought several other thoughtful and
far-sighted things.</p>

<p>That night at supper we told Mrs. Bax we
wanted to go out for the day. She had
hardly said anything that supper-time, and
now she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where are you going? Teaching Sunday
school?"</p>

<p>As it was Monday, we felt her poor brain
was wandering&mdash;most likely for want of
quiet. And the room smelt of tobacco smoke,
so we thought some one had been to see her
and perhaps been too noisy for her. So
Oswald said gently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, we are not going to teach Sunday
school."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bax sighed. Then she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going out myself to-morrow&mdash;for the
day."</p>

<p>"I hope it will not tire you too much," said
Dora, with soft-voiced and cautious politeness.
"If you want anything bought we could do it
for you, with pleasure, and you could have a
nice, quiet day at home."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mrs. Bax shortly; and
we saw she would do what she chose, whether
it was really for her own good or not.</p>

<p>She started before we did next morning,
and we were careful to be mouse-quiet till
the "Ship's" fly which contained her was out
of hearing. Then we had another yelling
competition, and No&euml;l won with that new
shriek of his that is like railway engines in
distress; and then we went and fetched Bates'
donkey and cart and packed our bales in it
and started, some riding and some running
behind.</p>

<p>Any faint distant traces of respectableness
that were left to our clothes were soon
covered up by the dust of the road and by
some of the ginger-beer bursting through
the violence of the cart, which had no
springs.</p>

<p>The first farm we stopped at the woman
really did want some pins, for though a very
stupid person, she was making a pink blouse,
and we said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do have some tape! You never know
when you may want it."</p>

<p>"I believe in buttons," she said. "No
strings for me, thank you."</p>

<p>But when Oswald said, "What about
pudding-strings? You can't button up
puddings as if they were pillows!" she
consented to listen to reason. But it was
only twopence altogether.</p>

<p>But at the next place the woman said we
were "mummickers," and told us to "get
along, do." And she set her dog at us; but
when Pincher sprang from the inmost recesses
of the cart she called her dog off.
But too late, for it and Pincher were
locked in the barking, scuffling, growling
embrace of deadly combat. When we had
separated the dogs she went into her house
and banged the door, and we went on
through the green flat marshes, among the
buttercups and may-bushes.</p>

<p>"I wonder what she meant by 'mummickers'?"
said H.O.</p>

<p>"She meant she saw our high-born airs
through our shabby clothes," said Alice.
"It's always happening, especially to princes.
There's nothing so hard to conceal as a really
high-bred air."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking," said Dicky, "whether
honesty wouldn't perhaps be the best policy&mdash;not
always, of course; but just this once. If
people knew what we were doing it for they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
might be glad to help on the good
work&mdash;&mdash; What?"</p>

<p>So at the next farm, which was half hidden
by trees, like the picture at the beginning of
"Sensible Susan," we tied the pony to the
gate-post and knocked at the door. It was
opened by a man this time, and Dora said
to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are honest traders. We are trying to
sell these things to keep a lady who is poor.
If you buy some you will be helping too.
Wouldn't you like to do that? It is a good
work, and you will be glad of it afterwards,
when you come to think over the acts of your
life."</p>

<p>"Upon my word an' 'onner!" said the man,
whose red face was surrounded by a frill of
white whiskers. "If ever I see a walkin'
Tract 'ere it stands!"</p>

<p>"She doesn't mean to be tractish," said
Oswald quickly; "it's only her way. But
we really are trying to sell things to help a
poor person&mdash;no humbug, sir&mdash;so if we <i>have</i>
got anything you want we shall be glad.
And if not&mdash;well, there's no harm in asking,
is there, sir?"</p>

<p>The man with the frilly whiskers was very
pleased to be called "sir"&mdash;Oswald knew he
would be&mdash;and he looked at everything we'd
got, and bought the head-stall and two tin-openers,
and a pot of marmalade, and a ball
of string, and a pair of braces. This came to
four and twopence, and we were very pleased.
It really seemed that our business was establishing
itself root and branch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>When it came to its being dinner-time,
which was first noticed through H.O. beginning
to cry and say he did not want to play
any more, it was found that we had forgotten
to bring any dinner. So we had to eat some
of our stock&mdash;the jam, the biscuits, and the
cucumber.</p>

<p>"I feel a new man," said Alice, draining
the last of the ginger-beer bottles. "At that
homely village on the brow of yonder hill we
shall sell all that remains of the stock, and go
home with money in both pockets."</p>

<p>But our luck had changed. As so often
happens, our hearts beat high with hopeful
thoughts, and we felt jollier than we had
done all day. Merry laughter and snatches
of musical song re-echoed from our cart, and
from round it as we went up the hill. All
Nature was smiling and gay. There was
nothing sinister in the look of the trees or
the road&mdash;or anything.</p>

<p>Dogs are said to have inside instincts that
warn them of intending perils, but Pincher
was not a bit instinctive that day somehow.
He sported gaily up and down the hedge-banks
after pretending rats, and once he was
so excited that I believe he was playing at
weasels and stoats. But of course there was
really no trace of these savage denizens of
the jungle. It was just Pincher's varied
imagination.</p>

<p>We got to the village, and with joyful expectations
we knocked at the first door we came to.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Alice had spread out a few choice treasures&mdash;needles,
pins, tape, a photograph-frame, and
the butter, rather soft by now, and the last
of the tin-openers&mdash;on a basket-lid, like the
fish-man does with herrings and whitings and
plums and apples (you cannot sell fish in the
country unless you sell fruit too. The author
does not know why this is).</p>

<p>The sun was shining, the sky was blue.
There was no sign at all of the intending
thunderbolt, not even when the door was
opened. This was done by a woman.</p>

<p>She just looked at our basket-lid of things
any one might have been proud to buy, and
smiled. I saw her do it. Then she turned her
traitorous head and called "Jim!" into the
cottage.</p>

<p>A sleepy grunt rewarded her.</p>

<p>"Jim, I say!" she repeated. "Come here
directly minute."</p>

<p>Next moment Jim appeared. He was Jim
to her because she was his wife, I suppose, but
to us he was the Police, with his hair ruffled&mdash;from
his hateful sofa-cushions, no doubt&mdash;and
his tunic unbuttoned.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he said in a husky voice, as
if he had been dreaming that he had a cold.
"Can't a chap have a minute to himself to
read the paper in?"</p>

<p>"You told me to," said the woman. "You
said if any folks come to the door with things
I was to call you, whether or no."</p>

<p>Even now we were blind to the disaster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
that was entangling us in the meshes of its
trap. Alice said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We've sold a good deal, but we've <i>some</i>
things left&mdash;very nice things. These crochet
needles&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the Police, who had buttoned up his
tunic in a hurry, said quite fiercely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let's have a look at your license."</p>

<p>"We didn't bring any," said No&euml;l, "but if
you will give us an order we'll bring you some
to-morrow." He thought a lisen was a thing
to sell that we ought to have thought of.</p>

<p>"None of your lip," was the unexpected
reply of the now plainly brutal constable.
"Where's your license, I say?"</p>

<p>"We have a license for our dog, but Father's
got it," said Oswald, always quick-witted, but
not, this time, quite quick enough.</p>

<p>"Your 'awker's license is what I want, as
well you knows, you young limb. Your
pedlar's license&mdash;your license to sell things.
You ain't half so half-witted as you want to
make out."</p>

<p>"We haven't got a pedlar's license," said
Oswald. If we had been in a book the Police
would have been touched to tears by Oswald's
simple honesty. He would have said "Noble
boy!" and then gone on to say he had only
asked the question to test our honour. But
life is not really at all the same as books. I
have noticed lots of differences. Instead of
behaving like the book-Police, this thick-headed
constable said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Blowed if I wasn't certain of it! Well,
my young blokes, you'll just come along o'
me to Sir James. I've got orders to bring up
the next case afore him."</p>

<p>"<i>Case!</i>" said Dora. "<i>Oh, don't!</i> We didn't
know we oughtn't to. We only wanted&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ho, yes," said the constable, "you can tell
all that to the magistrate; and anything you
say will be used against you."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it will," said Oswald. "Dora,
don't lower yourself to speak to him. Come,
we'll go home."</p>

<p>The Police was combing its hair with a half-toothless
piece of comb, and we turned to go.
But it was vain.</p>

<p>Ere any of our young and eager legs could
climb into the cart the Police had seized the
donkey's bridle. We could not desert our
noble steed&mdash;and besides, it wasn't really
ours, but Bates's, and this made any hope of
flight quite a forlorn one. For better, for
worse, we had to go with the donkey.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, for goodness' sake!" said Oswald
in stern undertones. "Bite your lips. Take
long breaths. Don't let him see we mind.
This beast's only the village police. Sir
James will be a gentleman. <i>He'll</i> understand.
Don't disgrace the house of Bastable.
Look here! Fall into line&mdash;no, Indian file
will be best, there are so few of us. Alice,
if you snivel I'll never say you ought to have
been a boy again. H.O., shut your mouth; no
one's going to hurt you&mdash;you're too young."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> trying," said Alice, gasping.</p>

<p>"No&euml;l," Oswald went on&mdash;now, as so often,
showing the brilliant qualities of the born
leader and general&mdash;"don't <i>you</i> be in a funk.
Remember how Byron fought for the Greeks
at Missy-what's-its-name. <i>He</i> didn't grouse,
and he was a poet, like you! Now look here,
let's be <i>game</i>. Dora, you're the eldest. Strike
up&mdash;any tune. We'll <i>march</i> up, and show this
sneak we Bastables aren't afraid, whoever
else is."</p>

<p>You will perhaps find it difficult to believe,
but we <i>did</i> strike up. We sang "The British
Grenadiers," and when the Police told us to
stow it we did not. And No&euml;l said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Singing isn't dogs or pedlaring. You
don't want a license for that."</p>

<p>"I'll soon show you!" said the Police.</p>

<p>But he had to jolly well put up with
our melodious song, because he knew that
there isn't really any law to prevent you
singing if you want to.</p>

<p>We went on singing. It soon got easier
than at first, and we followed Bates's donkey
and cart through some lodge gates and up a
drive with big trees, and we came out in front
of a big white house, and there was a lawn.
We stopped singing when we came in sight of
the house, and got ready to be polite to Sir
James. There were some ladies on the lawn
in pretty blue and green dresses. This
cheered us. Ladies are seldom quite heartless,
especially when young.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>The Police drew up Bates's donkey opposite
the big front door with pillars, and rang the
bell. Our hearts were beating desperately.
We cast glances of despair at the ladies.
Then, quite suddenly, Alice gave a yell that
wild Indian war-whoops are simply nothing
to, and tore across the lawn and threw her
arms round the green waist of one of the
ladies.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad!" she cried; "oh, save us!
We haven't done anything wrong, really and
truly we haven't."</p>

<p>And then we all saw that the lady was our
own Mrs. Red House, that we liked so much.
So we all rushed to her, and before that
Police had got the door answered we had told
her our tale. The other ladies had turned
away when we approached her, and gone
politely away into a shrubbery.</p>

<p>"There, there," she said, patting Alice and
No&euml;l and as much of the others as she could
get hold of. "Don't you worry, dears, don't.
I'll make it all right with Sir James. Let's
all sit down in a comfy heap, and get our
breaths again. I am so glad to see you all.
My husband met your father at lunch the
other day. I meant to come over and see you
to-morrow."</p>

<p>You cannot imagine the feelings of joy and
safeness that we felt now we had found someone
who knew we were Bastables, and not
vagrant outcasts like the Police thought.</p>

<p>The door had now been answered. We saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the base Police talking to the person who
answered it. Then he came towards us, very
red in the face.</p>

<p>"Leave off bothering the lady," he said,
"and come along of me. Sir James is in his
lib<i>ra</i>ry, and he's ready to do justice on you, so
he is."</p>

<p>Mrs. Red House jumped up, and so did we.
She said with smiles, as if nothing was
wrong&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good morning, Inspector!"</p>

<p>He looked pleased and surprised, as well he
might, for it'll be long enough before he's
within a mile of being <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>"Good morning, miss, I'm sure," he replied.</p>

<p>"I think there's been a little mistake,
Inspector," she said. "I expect it's some of
your men&mdash;led away by zeal for their duties.
But I'm sure <i>you'll</i> understand. I am staying
with Lady Harborough, and these children
are very dear friends of mine."</p>

<p>The Police looked very silly, but he said
something about hawking without a license.</p>

<p>"Oh no, not <i>hawking</i>," said Mrs. Red
House, "not <i>hawking</i>, surely! They were
just <i>playing</i> at it, you know. Your subordinates
must have been quite mistaken."</p>

<p>Our honesty bade us say that he was his
own only subordinate, and that he hadn't
been mistaken; but it is rude to interrupt,
especially a lady, so we said nothing.</p>

<p>The Police said firmly, "You'll excuse me,
miss, but Sir James expressly told me to lay a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
information directly next time I caught any of
'em at it without a license."</p>

<p>"But, you see, you didn't catch them at it."
Mrs. Red House took some money out of her
purse. "You might just give this to your
subordinates to console them for the mistake
they've made. And look here, these mistakes
do lead to trouble sometimes. So I'll tell you
what I'll do. I'll promise not to tell Sir
James a word about it. <i>So</i> nobody will be
blamed."</p>

<p>We listened breathless for his reply. He
put his hands behind him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, miss," he said at last, "you've
managed to put the Force in the wrong
somehow, which isn't often done, and I'm
blest if I know how you make it out. But
there's Sir James a-waiting for me to come
before him with my complaint. What am I
a-goin' to say to him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, anything," said Mrs. Red House;
"surely some one else has done something
wrong that you can tell him about?"</p>

<p>"There was a matter of a couple of snares
and some night lines," he said slowly, drawing
nearer to Mrs. Red House; "but I couldn't
take no money, of course."</p>

<p>"Of course not," she said; "I beg your
pardon for offering it. But I'll give you my
name and address, and if ever I can be of any
use to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned her back on us while she wrote
it down with a stumpy pencil he lent her;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
but Oswald could swear that he heard money
chink, and that there was something large
and round wrapped up in the paper she gave
him.</p>

<p>"Sorry for any little misunderstanding,"
the Police now said, feeling the paper with
his fingers; "and my respects to you, miss,
and your young friends. I'd best be going."</p>

<p>And he went&mdash;to Sir James, I suppose. He
seemed quite tamed. I hope the people who
set the snares got off.</p>

<p>"So <i>that's</i> all right," said Mrs. Red House.
"Oh, you dear children, you must stay to
lunch, and we'll have a splendid time."</p>

<p>"What a darling Princess you are!" No&euml;l
said slowly. "You are a witch Princess, too,
with magic powers over the Police."</p>

<p>"It's not a very pretty sort of magic," she
said, and she sighed.</p>

<p>"Everything about you is pretty," said
No&euml;l. And I could see him beginning to
make the faces that always precur his poetry-fits.
But before the fit could break out
thoroughly the rest of us awoke from our
stupor of grateful safeness and began to
dance round Mrs. Red House in a ring. And
the girls sang&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The rose is red, the violet's blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Carnation's sweet, and so are you,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>over and over again, so we had to join in;
though I think "She's a jolly good fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
would have been more manly and less like a
poetry book."</div>

<p>Suddenly a known voice broke in on our
singing.</p>

<p>"<i>Well!</i>" it said. And we stopped dancing.
And there were the other two ladies who had
politely walked off when we first discovered
Mrs. Red House. And one of them was Mrs.
Bax&mdash;of all people in the world! And she
was smoking a cigarette. So now we knew
where the smell of tobacco came from, in the
White House.</p>

<p>We said, "<i>Oh!</i>" in one breath, and were
silent.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," said Mrs. Bax, "that these
are the Sunday-school children I've been living
with these three long days?"</p>

<p>"We're sorry," said Dora, softly; "we
wouldn't have made a noise if we'd know you
were here."</p>

<p>"So I suppose," said Mrs. Bax. "Chloe, you
seem to be a witch. How have you galvanised
my six rag dolls into life like this?"</p>

<p>"Rag dolls!" said H.O., before we could
stop him. "I think you're jolly mean and
ungrateful; and it was sixpence for making
the organs fly."</p>

<p>"My brain's reeling," said Mrs. Bax, putting
her hands to her head.</p>

<p>"H.O. is very rude, and I am sorry," said
Alice, "but it <i>is</i> hard to be called rag dolls,
when you've only tried to do as you were
told."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, in answer to Mrs. Red House's
questions, we told how father had begged
us to be quiet, and how we had earnestly tried
to. When it was told, Mrs. Bax began to
laugh, and so did Mrs. Red House, and at last
Mrs. Bax said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my dears! you don't know how glad
I am that you're really alive! I began to think&mdash;oh&mdash;I
don't know what I thought! And
you're not rag dolls. You're heroes and
heroines, every man jack of you. And I do
thank you. But I never wanted to be quiet
like <i>that</i>. I just didn't want to be bothered
with London and tiresome grown-up people.
And now let's enjoy ourselves! Shall it be
rounders, or stories about cannibals?"</p>

<p>"Rounders first and stories after," said H.O.
And it was so.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bax, now that her true nature was
revealed, proved to be A1. The author does
not ask for a jollier person to be in the house
with. We had rare larks the whole time she
stayed with us.</p>

<p>And to think that we might never have
known her true character if she hadn't been
an old school friend of Mrs. Red House's, and
if Mrs. Red House hadn't been such a friend of
ours!</p>

<p>"Friendship," as Mr. William Smith so truly
says in his book about Latin, "is the crown of
life."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE POOR AND NEEDY</i></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">What</span> shall we do to-day, kiddies?" said
Mrs. Bax. We had discovered her true nature
but three days ago, and already she had
taken us out in a sailing-boat and in a motor
car, had given us sweets every day, and taught
us eleven new games that we had not known
before; and only four of the new games
were rotters. How seldom can as much be
said for the games of a grown-up, however
gifted!</div>

<p>The day was one of cloudless blue perfectness,
and we were all basking on the beach.
We had all bathed. Mrs. Bax said we might.
There are points about having a grown-up
with you, if it is the right kind. You can
then easily get it to say "Yes" to what you
want, and after that, if anything goes wrong
it is their fault, and you are pure from blame.
But nothing had gone wrong with the bathe,
and, so far, we were all alive, and not cold at
all, except our fingers and feet.</p>

<p>"What would you <i>like</i> to do?" asked Mrs.
Bax. We were far away from human sight
along the beach, and Mrs. Bax was smoking
cigarettes as usual.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," we all said politely. But
H.O. said&mdash;</p>

<p>"What about poor Miss Sandal?"</p>

<p>"Why poor?" asked Mrs. Bax.</p>

<p>"Because she is," said H.O.</p>

<p>"But how? What do you mean?" asked
Mrs. Bax.</p>

<p>"Why, isn't she?" said H.O.</p>

<p>"Isn't she what?" said Mrs. Bax.</p>

<p>"What you said why about," said H.O.</p>

<p>She put her hands to her head. Her short
hair was still damp and rumpled from contact
with the foaming billows of ocean.</p>

<p>"Let's have a fresh deal and start fair," she
said; "why do you think my sister is poor?"</p>

<p>"I forgot she was your sister," said H.O.,
"or I wouldn't have said it&mdash;honour bright I
wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it," said Mrs. Bax, and began
throwing stones at a groin in amiable silence.</p>

<p>We were furious with H.O., first because it
is such bad manners to throw people's poverty
in their faces, or even in their sisters' faces,
like H.O. had just done, and second because
it seemed to have put out of Mrs. Bax's head
what she was beginning to say about what
would we like to do.</p>

<p>So Oswald presently remarked, when he
had aimed at the stump she was aiming at,
and hit it before she did, for though a fair
shot for a lady, she takes a long time to get
her eye in.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bax, we should like to do whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
<i>you</i> like to do." This was real politeness and
true too, as it happened, because by this time
we could quite trust her not to want to do
anything deeply duffing.</p>

<p>"That's very nice of you," she replied, "but
don't let me interfere with any plans of yours.
My own idea was to pluck a waggonette from
the nearest bush. I suppose they grow freely
in these parts?"</p>

<p>"There's one at the 'Ship,'" said Alice; "it
costs seven-and-six to pluck it, just for going
to the station."</p>

<p>"Well, then! And to stuff our waggonette
with lunch and drive over to Lynwood Castle,
and eat it there."</p>

<p>"A picnic!" fell in accents of joy from the
lips of one and all.</p>

<p>"We'll also boil the billy in the castle courtyard,
and eat buns in the shadow of the keep."</p>

<p>"Tea as well?" said H.O., "with buns?
You can't be poor and needy any way, whatever
your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>We hastily hushed him, stifling his murmurs
with sand.</p>

<p>"I always think," said Mrs. Bax dreamily,
"that 'the more the merrier,' is peculiarly
true of picnics. So I have arranged&mdash;always
subject to your approval, of course&mdash;to meet
your friends, Mr. and Mrs. Red House, there,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>We drowned her conclusive remarks with a
cheer. And Oswald, always willing to be of
use, offered to go to the 'Ship' and see about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the waggonette. I like horses and stable-yards,
and the smell of hay and straw, and
talking to ostlers and people like that.</p>

<p>There turned out to be two horses belonging
to the best waggonette, or you could have a
one-horse one, much smaller, with the blue
cloth of the cushions rather frayed, and mended
here and there, and green in patches from
age and exposition to the weather.</p>

<p>Oswald told Mrs. Bax this, not concealing
about how shabby the little one was, and she
gloriously said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The pair by all means! We don't kill a
pig every day!"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said Dora, but if "killing a
pig" means having a lark, Mrs. Bax is as good
a pig-killer as any I ever knew.</p>

<p>It was splendid to drive (Oswald, on the box
beside the driver, who had his best coat with
the bright buttons) along the same roads that
we had trodden as muddy pedestrinators, or
travelled along behind Bates's donkey.</p>

<p>It was a perfect day, as I said before. We
were all clean and had our second-best things
on. I think second-bests are much more
comfy than first-bests. You feel equivalent
to meeting any one, and have "a heart for
any fate," as it says in the poetry-book, and
yet you are not starched and booted and
stiffened and tightened out of all human
feelings.</p>

<p>Lynwood Castle is in a hollow in the hills.
It has a moat all round it with water-lily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
leaves on it. I suppose there are lilies when
in season. There is a bridge over the moat&mdash;not
the draw kind of bridge. And the castle
has eight towers&mdash;four round and four square
ones, and a courtyard in the middle, all green
grass, and heaps of stones&mdash;stray bits of castle,
I suppose they are&mdash;and a great white may-tree
in the middle that Mrs. Bax said was
hundreds of years old.</p>

<p>Mrs. Red House was sitting under the may-tree
when we got there, nursing her baby, in
a blue dress and looking exactly like a picture
on the top of a chocolate-box.</p>

<p>The girls instantly wanted to nurse the baby
so we let them. And we explored the castle.
We had never happened to explore one
thoroughly before. We did not find the
deepest dungeon below the castle moat,
though we looked everywhere for it, but
we found everything else you can think of
belonging to castles&mdash;even the holes they used
to pour boiling lead through into the eyes of
besiegers when they tried to squint up to see
how strong the garrison was in the keep&mdash;and
the little slits they shot arrows through, and
the mouldering remains of the portcullis.
We went up the eight towers, every single
one of them, and some parts were jolly
dangerous, I can tell you. Dicky and I would
not let H.O. and No&euml;l come up the dangerous
parts. There was no lasting ill-feeling about
this. By the time we had had a thorough
good explore lunch was ready.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a glorious lunch&mdash;not too many
meaty things, but all sorts of cakes and
sweets, and grapes and figs and nuts.</p>

<p>We gazed at the feast, and Mrs. Bax said&mdash;</p>

<p>"There you are, young Copperfield, and a
royal spread you've got."</p>

<p>"<i>They</i> had currant wine," said No&euml;l, who
has only just read the book by Mr. Charles
Dickens.</p>

<p>"Well, so have you," said Mrs. Bax. And
we had. Two bottles of it.</p>

<p>"I never knew any one like you," said No&euml;l
to Mrs. Red House, dreamily with his mouth
full, "for knowing the things people really
like to eat, not the things that are good for
them, but what they <i>like</i>, and Mrs. Bax is just
the same."</p>

<p>"It was one of the things they taught at
our school," said Mrs. Bax. "Do you remember
the Saturday night feasts, Chloe, and how
good the cocoanut ice tasted after extra strong
peppermints?"</p>

<p>"Fancy you knowing <i>that!</i>" said H.O. "I
thought it was us found <i>that</i> out."</p>

<p>"I really know much more about things to
eat than <i>she</i> does," said Mrs. Bax. "I was
quite an old girl when she was a little thing
in pinafores. She was such a nice little girl."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if she was always nice,"
said No&euml;l, "even when she was a baby!"</p>

<p>Everybody laughed at this, except the
existing baby, and it was asleep on the
waggonette cushions, under the white may-tree,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
and perhaps if it had been awake it
wouldn't have laughed, for Oswald himself,
though possessing a keen sense of humour,
did not see anything to laugh at.</p>

<p>Mr. Red House made a speech after dinner,
and said drink to the health of everybody,
one after the other, in currant wine, which
was done, beginning with Mrs. Bax and ending
with H.O.</p>

<p>Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Somnus, avaunt! What shall we play
at?" and nobody, as so often happens, had
any idea ready. Then suddenly Mrs. Red
House said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good gracious, look there!" and we looked
there, and where we were to look was the
lowest piece of the castle wall, just beside the
keep that the bridge led over to, and what we
were to look at was a strange blobbiness of
knobbly bumps along the top, that looked
exactly like human heads.</p>

<p>It turned out, when we had talked about
cannibals and New Guinea, that human heads
were just exactly what they were. Not loose
heads, stuck on pikes or things like that, such
as there often must have been while the castle
stayed in the olden times it was built in and
belonged to, but real live heads with their
bodies still in attendance on them.</p>

<p>They were, in fact, the village children.</p>

<p>"Poor little Lazaruses!" said Mr. Red House.</p>

<p>"There's not such a bad slice of Dives' feast
left," said Mrs. Bax. "Shall we&mdash;&mdash;?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>So Mr. Red House went out by the keep
and called the heads in (with the bodies they
were connected with, of course), and they
came and ate up all that was left of the lunch.
Not the buns, of course, for those were sacred
to tea-time, but all the other things, even the
nuts and figs, and we were quite glad that
they should have them&mdash;really and truly we
were, even H.O.!</p>

<p>They did not seem to be very clever children,
or just the sort you would choose for your
friends, but I suppose you like to play, however
little you are other people's sort. So,
after they had eaten all there was, when Mrs.
Red House invited them all to join in games
with us we knew we ought to be pleased.
But village children are not taught rounders,
and though we wondered at first why their
teachers had not seen to this, we understood
presently. Because it is most awfully difficult
to make them understand the very simplest
thing.</p>

<p>But they could play all the ring games, and
"Nuts and May," and "There Came Three
Knights"&mdash;and another one we had never
heard of before. The singing part begins:&mdash;</p>

<p>The grown-ups played with all their heart
and soul&mdash;I expect it is but seldom they are
able to play, and they enjoy the novel excitement.
And when we'd been at it some time
we saw there was another head looking over
the wall.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Mrs. Bax, "here's another of
them, run along and ask it to come and join
in."</p>

<p>She spoke to the village children, but nobody
ran.</p>

<p>"Here, you go," she said, pointing at a girl
in red plaits tied with dirty sky-blue ribbon.</p>

<p>"Please, miss, I'd leifer not," replied the red-haired.
"Mother says we ain't to play along
of him."</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with him?" asked
Mrs. Red House.</p>

<p>"His father's in jail, miss, along of snares
and night lines, and no one won't give his
mother any work, so my mother says we ain't
to demean ourselves to speak to him."</p>

<p>"But it's not the child's fault," said Mrs. Red
House, "is it now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, miss," said the red-haired.</p>

<p>"But it's cruel," said Mrs. Bax. "How would
you like it if your father was sent to prison,
and nobody would speak to you?"</p>

<p>"Father's always kep' hisself respectable,"
said the girl with the dirty blue ribbon. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
can't be sent to gaol, not if you keeps yourself
respectable, you can't, miss."</p>

<p>"And do none of you speak to him?"</p>

<p>The other children put their fingers in their
mouths, and looked silly, showing plainly that
they didn't.</p>

<p>"Don't you feel sorry for the poor little
chap?" said Mrs. Bax.</p>

<p>No answer transpired.</p>

<p>"Can't you imagine how you'd feel if it was
<i>your</i> father?"</p>

<p>"My father always kep' hisself respectable,"
the red-haired girl said again.</p>

<p>"Well, I shall ask him to come and play
with us," said Mrs. Red House. "Little
pigs!" she added in low tones only heard by
the author and Mr. Red House.</p>

<p>But Mr. Red House said in a whisper that
no one overheard except Mrs. R. H. and the
present author.</p>

<p>"Don't, Puss-cat; it's no good. The poor
little pariah wouldn't like it. And these kids
only do what their parents teach them."</p>

<p>If the author didn't know what a stainless
gentleman Mr. Red House is he would think
he heard him mutter a word that gentlemen
wouldn't say.</p>

<p>"Tell off a detachment of consolation," Mr.
Red House went on; "look here, <i>our</i> kids&mdash;who'll
go and talk to the poor little chap?"</p>

<p>We all instantly said, "<i>I</i> will!"</p>

<p>The present author was chosen to be the
one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>When you think about yourself there is a
kind of you that is not what you generally
are but that you know you would like to be if
only you were good enough. Albert's uncle
says this is called your ideal of yourself. I
will call it your best I, for short. Oswald's
"best I" was glad to go and talk to that boy
whose father was in prison, but the Oswald that
generally exists hated being out of the games.
Yet the whole Oswald, both the best and the
ordinary, was pleased that he was the one
chosen to be a detachment of consolation.</p>

<p>He went out under the great archway, and
as he went he heard the games beginning
again. This made him feel noble, and yet he
was ashamed of feeling it. Your feelings are
a beastly nuisance, if once you begin to let
yourself think about them. Oswald soon saw
the broken boots of the boy whose father
was in jail so nobody would play with him,
standing on the stones near the top of the
wall where it was broken to match the boots.</p>

<p>He climbed up and said, "Hullo!"</p>

<p>To this remark the boy replied, "Hullo!"</p>

<p>Oswald now did not know what to say.
The sorrier you are for people the harder it
is to tell them so.</p>

<p>But at last he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've just heard about your father being
where he is. It's beastly rough luck. I hope
you don't mind my saying I'm jolly sorry for
you."</p>

<p>The boy had a pale face and watery blue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
eyes. When Oswald said this his eyes got
waterier than ever, and he climbed down to
the ground before he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't care so much, but it do upset
mother something crool."</p>

<p>It is awfully difficult to console those in
affliction. Oswald thought this, then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say; never mind if those beastly kids
won't play with you. It isn't your fault, you
know."</p>

<p>"Nor it ain't father's neither," the boy said;
"he broke his arm a-falling off of a rick, and
he hadn't paid up his club money along of
mother's new baby costing what it did when it
come, so there warn't nothing&mdash;and what's a
hare or two, or a partridge? It ain't as if
it was pheasants as is as dear to rear as
chicks."</p>

<p>Oswald did not know what to say, so he got
out his new pen-and-pencil-combined and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here! You can have this to keep if
you like."</p>

<p>The pale-eyed boy took it and looked at it
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You ain't foolin' me?"</p>

<p>And Oswald said no he wasn't, but he felt
most awfully rum and uncomfy, and though
he wanted most frightfully to do something
for the boy he felt as if he wanted to get away
more than anything else, and he never was
gladder in his life than when he saw Dora
coming along, and she said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"You go back and play, Oswald. I'm tired
and I'd like to sit down a bit."</p>

<p>She got the boy to sit down beside her, and
Oswald went back to the others.</p>

<p>Games, however unusually splendid, have
to come to an end. And when the games
were over and it was tea, and the village
children were sent away, and Oswald went to
call Dora and the prisoner's son, he found
nothing but Dora, and he saw at once, in his
far-sighted way, that she had been crying.</p>

<p>It was one of the A1est days we ever had,
and the drive home was good, but Dora was
horribly quiet, as though the victim of dark
interior thoughts.</p>

<p>And the next day she was but little better.</p>

<p>We were all paddling on the sands, but
Dora would not. And presently Alice left us
and went back to Dora, and we all saw across
the sandy waste that something was up.</p>

<p>And presently Alice came down and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dry your feet and legs and come to a
council. Dora wants to tell you something."</p>

<p>We dried our pink and sandy toes and we
came to the council. Then Alice said: "I
don't think H.O. is wanted at the council, it
isn't anything amusing; you go and enjoy
yourself by the sea, and catch the nice little
crabs, H.O. dear."</p>

<p>H.O. said: "You always want me to be out
of everything. I can be councils as well as
anybody else."</p>

<p>"Oh, H.O.!" said Alice, in pleading tones,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
"not if I give you a halfpenny to go and buy
bulls-eyes with?"</p>

<p>So then he went, and Dora said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can't think how I could do it when you'd
all trusted me so. And yet I couldn't help it.
I remember Dicky saying when you decided
to give it me to take care of&mdash;about me being
the most trustworthy of all of us. I'm not fit
for any one to speak to. But it did seem the
really right thing at the time, it really and
truly did. And now it all looks different."</p>

<p>"What has she done?" Dicky asked this,
but Oswald almost knew.</p>

<p>"Tell them," said Dora, turning over on her
front and hiding her face partly in her hands,
and partly in the sand.</p>

<p>"She's given all Miss Sandal's money to that
little boy that the father of was in prison,"
said Alice.</p>

<p>"It was one pound thirteen and sevenpence
halfpenny," sobbed Dora.</p>

<p>"You ought to have consulted us, I do think,
really," said Dicky. "Of course, I see you're
sorry now, but I do think that."</p>

<p>"How could I consult you?" said Dora;
"you were all playing Cat and Mouse, and he
wanted to get home. I only wish you'd heard
what he told me&mdash;that's all&mdash;about his mother
being ill, and nobody letting her do any work
because of where his father is, and his baby
brother ill, poor little darling, and not enough
to eat, and everything as awful as you can
possibly think. I'll save up and pay it all back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
out of my own money. Only do forgive me,
all of you, and say you don't despise me for a
forger and embezzlementer. I couldn't help
it."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you couldn't," said the sudden
voice of H.O., who had sneaked up on his
young stomach unobserved by the council.
"You shall have all my money too, Dora,
and here's the bulls-eye halfpenny to begin
with." He crammed it into her hand.
"Listen? I should jolly well think I did
listen," H.O. went on. "I've just as much
right as anybody else to be in at a council,
and I think Dora was quite right, and the rest
of you are beasts not to say so, too, when you
see how she's blubbing. Suppose it had been
<i>your</i> darling baby-brother ill, and nobody
hadn't given you nothing when they'd got
pounds and pounds in their silly pockets?"</p>

<p>He now hugged Dora, who responded.</p>

<p>"It wasn't her own money," said Dicky.</p>

<p>"If you think <i>you're</i> our darling baby-brother&mdash;&mdash;"
said Oswald.</p>

<p>But Alice and No&euml;l began hugging Dora
and H.O., and Dicky and I felt it was no go.
Girls have no right and honourable feelings
about business, and little boys are the same.</p>

<p>"All right," said Oswald rather bitterly, "if
a majority of the council backs Dora up, we'll
give in. But we must all save up and repay
the money, that's all. We shall all be beastly
short for ages."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Dora, and now her sobs were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
beginning to turn into sniffs, "you don't
know how I felt! And I've felt most awful
ever since, but those poor, poor people&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Bax came down on to
the beach by the wooden steps that lead from
the sea-wall where the grass grows between
the stones.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" she said, "hurt yourself, my
Dora-dove?"</p>

<p>Dora was rather a favourite of hers.</p>

<p>"It's all right now," said Dora.</p>

<p>"<i>That's</i> all right," said Mrs. Bax, who has
learnt in anti-what's-its-name climes the great
art of not asking too many questions. "Mrs.
Red House has come to lunch. She went this
morning to see that boy's mother&mdash;you know,
the boy the others wouldn't play with?"</p>

<p>We said "Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Red House has arranged to get
the woman some work&mdash;like the dear she is&mdash;the
woman told her that the little lady&mdash;and
that's you, Dora&mdash;had given the little boy one
pound thirteen and sevenpence."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bax looked straight out to sea through
her gold-rimmed spectacles, and went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"That must have been about all you had
among the lot of you. I don't want to jaw,
but I think you're a set of little bricks, and I
must say so or expire on the sandy spot."</p>

<p>There was a painful silence.</p>

<p>H.O. looked, "There, what did I tell you?"
at the rest of us.</p>

<p>Then Alice said, "We others had nothing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
do with it. It was Dora's doing." I suppose
she said this because we did not mean to tell
Mrs. Bax anything about it, and if there was
any brickiness in the act we wished Dora to
have the consolement of getting the credit
of it.</p>

<p>But of course Dora couldn't stand that. She
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Bax, it was very wrong of me.
It wasn't my own money, and I'd no business
to, but I was so sorry for the little boy and
his mother and his darling baby-brother. The
money belonged to some one else."</p>

<p>"Who?" Mrs. Bax asked ere she had time
to remember the excellent Australian rule
about not asking questions.</p>

<p>And H.O. blurted out, "It was Miss Sandal's
money&mdash;every penny," before we could stop
him.</p>

<p>Once again in our career concealment was
at an end. The rule about questions was again
unregarded, and the whole thing came out.</p>

<p>It was a long story, and Mrs. Red House
came out in the middle, but nobody could
mind her hearing things.</p>

<p>When she knew all, from the plain living to
the pedlar who hadn't a license, Mrs. Bax
spoke up like a man, and said several kind
things that I won't write down.</p>

<p>She then went on to say that her sister was
not poor and needy at all, but that she lived
plain and thought high just because she
liked it!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>We were very disappointed as soon as we
had got over our hardly believing any one
could&mdash;like it, I mean&mdash;and then Mrs. Red
House said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir James gave me five pounds for the
poor woman, and she sent back thirty of your
shillings. She had spent three and sevenpence,
and they had a lovely supper of boiled
pork and greens last night. So now you've
only got that to make up, and you can buy a
most splendid present for Miss Sandal."</p>

<p>It is difficult to choose presents for people
who live plain and think high because they
like it. But at last we decided to get books.
They were written by a person called Emerson,
and of a dull character, but the backs
were very beautiful, and Miss Sandal was
most awfully pleased with them when she
came down to her cottage with her partially
repaired brother, who had fallen off the
scaffold when treating a bricklayer to tracts.</p>

<p>This is the end of the things we did when
we were at Lymchurch in Miss Sandal's
house.</p>

<p>It is the last story that the present author
means ever to be the author of. So goodbye,
if you have got as far as this.</p>
